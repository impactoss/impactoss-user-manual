### 4.2 User roles and rights

[Indicator managers ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for uploading reports/data against assigned indicators

[Contributors ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- registered users who can upload data, which will need to be reviewed by the relevant Manager

[Managers ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for sets of recommendations and ensuring 'Contributors' upload reports/data on time and for reviewing/approving publicly submitted reports

_Indicator Managers, Contributors and Managers are responsible for the input and management of data only. Information on how each of those roles is fulfilled can be found in the _[_How to: Report chapter_](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md)

[Administrators ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)are responsible for keeping everything else up to date - recommendations, actions, indicators, categories and content pages. They are also responsible for assigning indicators to users and reporting bugs.

The role of Administrators is therefore of critical importance to the overall success and more complex than other roles. This 'User' section of the manual is specifically intended to guide Administrators in the exercise of their role, taking each area of the application one at a time, and providing a number of common use cases.

The way in which Administrators carry out their role is by either 'Adding' new content or 'Editing' existing content.

#### Adding Content

One of the roles of administrators are is adding the base content, such as:

* Recommendations
* Actions
* Indicators
* Thematic cluster titles
* Categories
* Actions
* Affected persons

There are a variety of methods of adding content, including through batch importing. These processes are outlined in the relevant pages below.

#### 'Edit' v 'Filter' Mode

'Filter' mode is available to all users and visitors and allows for actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets to be filtered by [category, connected category, connection or status](/glossary.md).

![](/assets/Filter.png)

As soon as an Administrator is logged in this view changes to: ![](/assets/Filter 2.png)

\(1\) The filter list now becomes a filter or edit list, with filter selected as the default \(coloured orange\)

\(2\) Options to select the page of results or individual results now also appear.

As soon as any of the results are selected by the user the mode will automatically switch from 'filter' to 'edit'![](/assets/Filter 3.png)Once the Administrator is in 'Edit' mode they can update the selected entries \(either Actions, Indicators, Recommendations or SDG Targets\) and change the entry associations \(e.g. the category tags, actions, indicators, thematic cluster\). This allows the Administrator to edit entries in bulk. The full details of what is possible for each type of entry is discussed in the sections below and is only applicable to Administrators.
