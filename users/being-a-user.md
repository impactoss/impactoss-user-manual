### 4.2 User roles and rights





[Indicator managers ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for uploading reports/data against assigned indicators

[Contributors ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- registered users who can upload data, which will need to be reviewed by the relevant Manager

[Managers ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for sets of recommendations and ensuring 'Contributors' upload reports/data on time and for reviewing/approving publicly submitted reports

_Indicator Managers, Contributors and Managers are responsible for the input and management of data only. Information on how each of those roles is fulfilled can be found in the _[_How to: Report chapter_](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md)

[Administrators ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)are responsible for keeping everything else up to date - recommendations, actions, indicators, categories and content pages. They are also responsible for assigning indicators to users and reporting bugs.

The role of Administrators is therefore of critical importance to the overall success and more complex than other roles. This 'User' section of the manual is specifically intended to guide Administrators in the exercise of their role, taking each area of the application one at a time, and providing a number of common use cases.

The way in which Administrators carry out their role is by either 'Adding' new content or 'Editing' existing content.

### 2.6 How to: Register and assign user roles

This tool allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way information is collected and implementation is tracked.

##### Visitors

Vistors can explore all of the information contained within the tool, track how the Government is performing or even become one of the registered users detailed below. This manual contains a whole chapter on how Visitors can make the most out of visiting this site. To read, [click here](/visitors/using-as-a-visitor.md).

##### Contributors

Contributors are registered users who can submit information relating to the National Implementation Plan or the SDGs, but don't have to be part of the Government. For instance, a contributor could be an NGO who has been doing work in a particular area that is helping to achieve one of the areas of the Implementation Plan or the SDGs. Any organisation or individual can register as a user and contribute data as they see fit. In addition to raising awareness of the work they are doing this can also help to foster better coordination of activities with Government. For more information on adding reports, click [here](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md).

##### Indicator Owners

Indicator Owners are key to the success of data - they are the registered users who upload information against all of the indicators. The most common user who contributes is the 'Indicator Owner' - that is a user who has had a particular indicator assigned to them and is responsible for uploading the data. A user becomes a Indicator Ownerwhen an Administrator allocates one of more indicators to that user. That Indicator Manager then becomes responsible for uploading data at the required time \(set by the Administrator\). The Indicator Owner will receive an email when it is time to upload that information. For more information on adding reports, click [here](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md).

![](/assets/Implementation Plan.png)                      _\*\*All information demonstrated is for illustrative purposes only \*\*_

The image above demonstrates what actions, indicators and look like in the Implementation Plan. In the example highlighted, two indicators have been set for the Action \(training for judges, prosecutors and MJCA\). The final column demonstrates when the information relating to those indicators is due. On that date the user who has been assigned to these indicators - in this case likely the training facilitator - will receive an email with a link requesting that they upload  the information for each.

Should they fail to do so then they will continue to receive email reminders until the data has been uploaded. This is the first safeguard against non-entry built into the application. Data can be uploaded in any file type format.

##### Category Managers

Category Managers play an oversight role to ensure that data is entered when required - thus providing the second safeguard against non-entry of data.

For each 'Human Rights Body' category a 'Category Manager' should be assigned by one of the Administrators. The role of the Manager is to ensure that all data for any indicators relating to their assigned 'Human Rights Body' is entered in a timely manner. If a 'Contributor' for one of these indicators repeatedly fails to enter the required data at the specified time then the Manager will receive an automated email notifying them of this failure. It is then their responsibility to follow up directly with the Contributor to ensure the information is uploaded. If the Contributor still does not upload the required information then the Manager should raise this with the relevant Ministry at the next scheduled meeting of the National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-Up.

The second role of Managers occurs when data/information is submitted by an organisation or member of the public who has not been assigned as a contributor. This may be an NGO who has undertaken work in an area relevant to a particular indicator within the Implementation Plan. It is the role of the Manager to review the information and decide whether it should be published or not. At each NMRF quarterly meeting each Manager should provide an overview of recently added data/information to the Working Group.

##### Administrators

Administrators play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of the application. They are responsible for:

* Assigning contributors and managers to indicators and human rights bodies respectively
* Adding newly received recommendations into the database and assigning them to clusters, as directed by the NMRF
* maintaining and updating the category lists
* Adding new actions and indicators as required
* Maintaining content pages
* Reporting bugs

The role of Administrator is the most wide-ranging of all the roles. This manual goes into detail in all of the areas of responsibility of Administrators and how to undertake all of the functions in Chapter 4 - 'Users'.

To go to Chapter 4, [click here](/users/being-a-user.md).

#### Adding Content

One of the roles of administrators are is adding the base content, such as:

* Recommendations
* Actions
* Indicators
* Thematic cluster titles
* Categories
* Actions
* Affected persons

There are a variety of methods of adding content, including through batch importing. These processes are outlined in the relevant pages below.

#### 'Edit' v 'Filter' Mode

'Filter' mode is available to all users and visitors and allows for actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets to be filtered by [category, connected category, connection or status](/glossary.md).

![](/assets/Filter.png)

As soon as an Administrator is logged in this view changes to: ![](/assets/Filter 2.png)

\(1\) The filter list now becomes a filter or edit list, with filter selected as the default \(coloured orange\)

\(2\) Options to select the page of results or individual results now also appear.

As soon as any of the results are selected by the user the mode will automatically switch from 'filter' to 'edit'![](/assets/Filter 3.png)Once the Administrator is in 'Edit' mode they can update the selected entries \(either Actions, Indicators, Recommendations or SDG Targets\) and change the entry associations \(e.g. the category tags, actions, indicators, thematic cluster\). This allows the Administrator to edit entries in bulk. The full details of what is possible for each type of entry is discussed in the sections below and is only applicable to Administrators.
