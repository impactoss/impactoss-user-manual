# 4. In Depth: User types & roles

This tool allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users types and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types and roles allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way information is collected and implementation is tracked.

### 4.1 User types

#### Visitor

Any member of the public visiting the site. This manual contains a whole chapter on how Visitors can make the most out of visiting this site. To read, [click here](/visitors/using-as-a-visitor.md).



###### Prerequisites

* None \(role "Unauthorised" implicitly assumed\)

###### Rights

* Access and explore all published information using the filters and search functions 
* Track progress on the National Implementation Plan and thus how the Government is performing

---

#### Guest contributor

Contributors are registered users who can submit information relating to the National Implementation Plan or the SDGs, but don't have to be part of the Government. NGOs, NHRIs or any member of the public can thus contribute data to show progress towards any part of the National Implementation Plan or SDGs. This gives groups and individuals a platform to showcase their work to Government and to encourage more coordinated activities. For instance, a contributor could be an NGO who has been doing work in a particular area that is helping to achieve one of the areas of the Implementation Plan or the SDGs. Any organisation or individual can register as a user and contribute data as they see fit. In addition to raising awareness of the work they are doing this can also help to foster better coordination of activities with Government. For more information on adding reports, click [here](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md).

###### Prerequisites

* Registered \(role "Guest" implicitly assumed\)

###### Rights

* Add progress reports to existing indicators and upload data. Note: progress reports will have to be reviewed and published first by an authorised user to become public

---

#### Indicator Manager

The data owner for an indicator and this are key to the success of the data entry - they are the registered users who upload information against all of the indicators. Once assigned to an indicator the user becomes responsible for uploading data at the required time. For more information on adding reports, click [here](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md).
Indicator Owners are key to the success of data - they are the registered users who upload information against all of the indicators. The most common user who contributes is the 'Indicator Owner' - that is a user who has had a particular indicator assigned to them and is responsible for uploading the data. A user becomes a Indicator Ownerwhen an Administrator allocates one of more indicators to that user. That Indicator Manager then becomes responsible for uploading data at the required time \(set by the Administrator\). The Indicator Owner will receive an email when it is time to upload that information. For more information on adding reports, click [here](/getting-started-quick-start/reporting-and-follow-up.md).

###### Prerequisites

* At least role "Contributor" (assigned by with at least role "Manager")


* Assigned to indicator (by user with at least role "Manager")

###### Responsibilities

* Add progress reports and upload data for the indicator the user has been assigned to
* Receive automated reminder emails when a progress report is due \(weekly, 30 days ahead of due date\) and overdue \(daily, after due date has passed\)


###### Example

![](/assets/Implementation Plan.png)                      _\*\*All information demonstrated is for illustrative purposes only \*\*_

The image above demonstrates what actions, indicators and look like in the Implementation Plan. In the example highlighted, two indicators have been set for the Action \(training for judges, prosecutors and MJCA\). The final column demonstrates when the information relating to those indicators is due. On that date the user who has been assigned to these indicators - in this case likely the training facilitator - will receive an email with a link requesting that they upload  the information for each.

Should they fail to do so then they will continue to receive email reminders until the data has been uploaded. This is the first safeguard against non-entry built into the application. Data can be uploaded in any file type format.

### 2.6 How to: Register and assign user roles

This tool allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way information is collected and implementation is tracked.


##### Contributors

##### Indicator Owners


##### Category Managers



##### Administrators

Administrators play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of the application. They are responsible for:

* Assigning contributors and managers to indicators and human rights bodies respectively
* Adding newly received recommendations into the database and assigning them to clusters, as directed by the NMRF
* maintaining and updating the category lists
* Adding new actions and indicators as required
* Maintaining content pages
* Reporting bugs

The role of Administrator is the most wide-ranging of all the roles. This manual goes into detail in all of the areas of responsibility of Administrators and how to undertake all of the functions in Chapter 4 - 'Users'.

To go to Chapter 4, [click here](/users/being-a-user.md).

#### Adding Content

One of the roles of administrators are is adding the base content, such as:

* Recommendations
* Actions
* Indicators
* Thematic cluster titles
* Categories
* Actions
* Affected persons

There are a variety of methods of adding content, including through batch importing. These processes are outlined in the relevant pages below.

#### 'Edit' v 'Filter' Mode

'Filter' mode is available to all users and visitors and allows for actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets to be filtered by [category, connected category, connection or status](/glossary.md).

![](/assets/Filter.png)

As soon as an Administrator is logged in this view changes to: ![](/assets/Filter 2.png)

\(1\) The filter list now becomes a filter or edit list, with filter selected as the default \(coloured orange\)

\(2\) Options to select the page of results or individual results now also appear.

As soon as any of the results are selected by the user the mode will automatically switch from 'filter' to 'edit'![](/assets/Filter 3.png)Once the Administrator is in 'Edit' mode they can update the selected entries \(either Actions, Indicators, Recommendations or SDG Targets\) and change the entry associations \(e.g. the category tags, actions, indicators, thematic cluster\). This allows the Administrator to edit entries in bulk. The full details of what is possible for each type of entry is discussed in the sections below and is only applicable to Administrators.
