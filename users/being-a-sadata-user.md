#### Sadata Administration

Sadata Administrators are the Users who maintain the core information within the application. To recap:

[Contributors ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for uploading reports/data against assigned indicators

[Managers ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)- responsible for sets of recommendations and ensuring 'Contributors' upload reports/data on time and for reviewing/approving publicly submitted reports

[Administrators ](/getting-started/users-and-roles.md)are responsible for keeping everything else in Sadata up to date - recommendations, actions, indicators, categories and content pages.

The role of Administrators is therefore of critical importance to the overall success of Sadata and more complex than other roles. This 'User' section of the manual is specifically intended to guide Administrators in the exercise of their role, taking each area of the application one at a time, and providing a number of common use cases.
