### 4.3 Actions

As in all areas of Sadata, Administrators can 'add or edit' data via the Actions page.

#### Adding Actions

There are two ways for an Administrator to add actions:

1\) Add single actions

2\) Import a file of multiple actions

![](/assets/Add action.png)Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page \(pictured above\).

**Adding a single action: **Click on the 'Add Action' icon and the following form will appear:

1\) Title: Short title of action

2\) Description: Additional details of action

3\) Recommendations: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the recommendations contained within the Sadata database. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new recommendation from here to link to the Action if they wish.

4\) SDG Targets: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the SDG targets. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new SDG Target from here to link to the Action if they wish.

5\) Indicators: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the Indicators. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new Indicator from here to link to the Action if they wish.

6\) Status: Automatically set to draft, the Administrator can change this to public once the Action is ready to be published on the public Sadata site. The status of actions can also be changed in bulk using the filtering system on the Actions page \(see below\)

7\) Target date: The target date for completion of the actiivity

8\) Target date comment: Any relevant comments regarding the target date \(optional\)

9\) Thematic cluster: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the pre-existing Thematic Clusters. By linking an action to a thematic cluster it will automatically be linked to all of the recommendations contained within that cluster. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new Thematic Cluster from here to link to the Action if they wish

10\) Organisation: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to assign primary responsibility for an Action to an Organisations. At the bottom of the drop down menu there is an' Add' button where the Administrator can add a new organisation if the relevant one has not already been entered into Sadata

11\) Cancel/Save: This is where the Administrator can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button

**Adding multiple actions**

By cllicking on the 'Import' button \(top image\) the Administrator will be provided with a CSV template download \(see image below\) for batch importing multiple Actions. Once in the required format the Administrator can click on the 'Select File' button and upload their file and all of the Actions will automatically be imported into Sadata. ![](/assets/Batch import.png)

#### Editing Actions

There are also two ways in which Actions can be edited; individually and batch editing.

**Individual editing**

Individual editing is as simple as finding the action you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the action title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button \(circled\):

Clicking the edit button allows the Administrator to edit all of the fields associated with that action.

**Batch editing**

Batch editing of actions \(or other entities within Sadata such as recommendations, indicators or SDG targets\) is a powerful feature that allows Administrators to efficiently edit actions in a variety of ways including:

* By setting the status of multiple actions from draft to public
* By linking multiple actions with any category \(i.e. a thematic cluster, human rights issue, etc.\)
