### 4.5 Recommendations

As in all areas of Sadata, Administrators can 'add or edit' data via the Recommendations page. 

#### Adding Recommendations

There are two ways for an Administrator to add indicators:

1\) Add single recommendations

2\) Import a file of multiple recommendations

![](/assets/Add recommendations.png)Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page \(pictured above\).

**Adding a single recommendation: **Click on the 'Add Recommendation' icon and the following form will appear:

![](/assets/Add recommendation 2.png)

1\) ID: Administrator can add a recommendation ID. This should be the reference given by the relevant UN body. If left blank an ID will automatically be assigned.

2\) Title: Short title of recommendation

3\) Government response: Only applicable to UPR recommendations, which a Government can 'accept' or 'note'. The response for UPR recommendations should be recorded here

4\) Government response comment: When Government's 'note' comments they often explain why they are not accepting them. Details of such reasoning should be recorded here. 

5\) Actions: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the recommendation to any of the actions stored within Sadata. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new action from here to link to the recommendation if they wish.

6\) Status: Automatically set to draft, the Administrator can change this to public once the recommendation is ready to be published on the public Sadata site. The status of recommendations can also be changed in bulk using the filtering system on the recommendation page \(see below\)

7\) Human rights body: The Administrator can click on the drop down menu to select which human rights body the recommendation came from. If the human rights body does not already exit in Sadata they can click on the 'add' button to add a new body. 

8\) Cycle: The Administrator can click on the drop down menu to select which reporting cycle the recommendation came from \(e.g. Samoa's 2nd CEDAW review, or 3rd UPR\). If the cycle does not already exit in Sadata they can click on the 'add' button to add a new cycle.

9\) Human rights issue: The Administrator can click on the drop down menu to select which human rights issue the recommendation relates to. The Administrator can select as many issues as are relevant for that recommendation. Alternatively the Administrator can do this using the batch edit feature \(see below for more details\)

10\) Affected persons: The Administrator can click on the drop down menu to select which affected persons the recommendation relates to. The Administrator can select as many issues as are relevant for that recommendation. Alternatively the Administrator can do this using the batch edit feature \(see below for more details\)

**Adding multiple indicators**

By cllicking on the 'Import' button \(top image\) the Administrator will be provided with a CSV template download \(see image below\) for batch importing multiple Indicators. Once in the required format the Administrator can click on the 'Select File' button and upload their file and all of the Indicators will automatically be imported into Sadata. ![](/assets/Batch import indicators.png)

#### Editing Indicators

There are also two ways in which Indicators can be edited; individually and batch editing.

**Individual editing**

Individual editing is as simple as finding the indicator you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the indicator title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button \(circled\):

![](/assets/Edit indicator.png)

Clicking the edit button allows the Administrator to edit all of the fields associated with that indicator including:

* Adding/editing the assigned user responsible for progress reports
* Adding/editing the due date for progress reports
* Adding/editing the actions the indicator is linked to
* Adding/editing the SDG targets the indicator is linked to
* Editing the draft/public status of the indicator
* Editing the draft/public status of the action
* Deleting the indicator
* Editing the title, description or reference of the indicator

**Batch editing**

Batch editing of indicators \(or other entities within Sadata such as recommendations, actions or SDG targets\) is a powerful feature that allows Administrators to efficiently edit indicators in a variety of ways including:

* By setting the status of multiple indicators from draft to public
* By linking multiple actions with any connection \(i.e. action or SDG targets\)

Batch editing is a simple process - first the Administrator needs to identify and select the indicators they wish to batch edit and then secondly they update the selected indicators as they wish.

1\) The Administrator can select the indicators they wish by first using the filtering and search functions on the 'Indicators' main page to bring up the relevant indicators on their screen. More information on how to use these functions can be found [here](/visitors/actions.md). Once the relevant indicators have been identified the Administrator can either:

* Select individual indicators using the checkbox next to each action \(see \#1 on image below\)
* Select all indicators on the page displayed \(see \#1 on image below\)
* Select all indicators returned by the search and filtering results if they do not fit onto a single display page \(see \#3 on image below![](/assets/Batch edit indictors.png)

2\) Once the relevant actions have been selected the Administrator can then use the menu on left hand side of the screen to link the selected indicators to any action or SDG target, or update the status from draft to public \(or vice versa\). Batch editing indicators is the same process as for actions. More details on how to carry out this function can be found [here](/users/actions.md).

#### Adding Unscheduled & Scheduled Progress Reports

Administrators may be required to add progress reports to an indicator - either unscheduled or scheduled. They can do that by searching for the relevant indicator using the filter and search function and then clicking on the title. The next scren then provides two opportunities to add a progress report. See below:

![](/assets/Add report.png)Clicking on either of these links will take the Administrator to the following form:

![](/assets/Admin add progress report.png)1\) Title: The title of the progress report \(E.g. 'Domestic violence stats Q3 2017' or 'NHRI CEDAW Training Workshop for Police Recruits'

2\) Description: Full details of the progress report

3\) Upload document: Information/data related to the indicator should be uploaded via this link

4\) Public/Private: The status of the uploaded document can be set to public or private depending on whether there is sensitive information contained within that should not be available publicly

5\) Draft/public: The status of the progress report. Once it is ready to publish on the public site, this status should be immediately changed to public.

6\) Due date: As an administrator, both scheduled and unscheduled progress reports can be entered into Sadata. The Administrator is required to indicate here whether the progress report they are uploading is unscheduled or scheduled.

7\) Save/cancel: This is where the Administrator can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button
