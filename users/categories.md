#### Editing/Adding Categories

![](/assets/Editing categories.png)

In addition to being able to use the 'Categories' page to view information in the same manner as visitors, Administrators can also 'Add' and 'Edit' categories. To do so, the Administrator first selects the Category they would like to add or edit within using the menu on the left hand side of the screen \(1\).

If the Administrator wishes to edit an existing category they click on the entry they wish to edit \(2\), which will bring up the sub-category and an edit option. Clicking on the edit button will allow the Administrator to amend any of the details of that sub-category. ![](/assets/Editing categories 2.png)A list of all the sub-categories at the time of writing, that can be edited in this manner can be found [here](/users/categories.md). 

If the Administrator wishes to add a new sub-category \(i.e. a new human rights body, cycle, issue, cluster, etc.\) then they simply click on the 'Add category' icon \(top image, 3\)![](/assets/Add sub category.png) 

1\) Reference: A reference ID can be manually added or Sadata will automatically assign an ID

2\) Title: A short description of the category \(e.g. name of the human rights body, overview of thematic cluster, organisation name, etc.\)

3\) Short title: An abbreviated version of the title that will be used for the associated tag. E.g. ![](/assets/Tags.png)

4\) Description: Longer description if required \(optional\). This is a useful field to provide visitors to Sadata with more information on a particular sub-category. 

5\) Recommendations: Clicking on the drop-down list allows the Administrator to tag any recommendations with Sadata with the newly created sub-category.
