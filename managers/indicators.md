### Manage Indicators

Administrators and Managers can 'add or edit' data via the Indicators page. They are both also able to add progress reports to indicators.

#### Adding Indicators

There are two ways for an Administrator to add indicators:

1. Add single indicators (see below)
2. Import a file of multiple indicators (see [Import content](/managers/import.md))

Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page (pictured above).

##### Adding a single indicator:

Click on the 'Add Indicator' icon and the following form will appear:

1. ID: Administrator can add an indicator ID. If left blank an ID will automatically be assigned.

2. Title: Short title of indicator

3. Description: Additional details of indicator

4. Actions: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the indicators to any of the actions contained within the database. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new action from here to link to the indicator if they wish.

5. SDG Targets: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the indicator to any of the SDG targets. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new SDG Target from here to link to the indicator if they wish.

6. Status: Automatically set to draft, the Administrator can change this to public once the indicator is ready to be published on the public site. The status of actions can also be changed in bulk using the filtering system on the indicator page (see below)

7. Due date: The due date for the next indicator report

8. Repeat? If the indicator requires regular report (e.g. gender based violence statistics every quarter) then a repeat data report due date can be set, meaning the user responsible for providing the data reports will receive regular email reminders on the dates set

9. Assigned user: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to choose from all of the registered users who is responsible for this indicator. Once allocated, this user will receive automated email reminders when progress reports are due

10. Cancel/Save: This is where the Administrator can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button

#### Editing Indicators

There are also two ways in which Indicators can be edited;

* edit individually (ee below)
* batch edit (see [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md))

##### Individual editing

Individual editing is as simple as finding the indicator you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the indicator title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button (circled):

Clicking the edit button allows the Administrator to edit all of the fields associated with that indicator including:

* Adding/editing the assigned user responsible for progress reports
* Adding/editing the due date for progress reports
* Adding/editing the actions the indicator is linked to
* Adding/editing the SDG targets the indicator is linked to
* Editing the draft/public status of the indicator
* Deleting the indicator
* Editing the title, description or reference of the indicator
