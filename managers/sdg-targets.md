### Manage SDG Targets (optional configuration)

> _Available for: [Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md)_

Administrators and Managers can 'add or edit' data via the SDG Targets page.

#### Adding SDG targets

The SDG targets are internationally agreed so they are unlikely to need to change regularly like indicators, recommendations and actions. However, States may wish to develop national indicators relevant to their context, which need to be added to the application. There are two ways for an Administrator/Manager to add SDG targets:

1. Add single SDG targets (see below)
2. Import a file of multiple SDG targets (see [Import content](/managers/import.md))

Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page (pictured above).

##### Adding a single SDG target:

Click on the 'Add Recommendation' icon and the following form will appear:

1. ID: Administrator/Manager can add an SDG Target ID. This should be the SDG target indicator number. If left blank an ID will automatically be assigned.

2. Title: Title of SDG target

3. Description: A long description of the SDG target can be entered here

4. Actions: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator/Manager to link the SDG Target to any of the actions stored. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator/Manager can choose to add a new action from here to link to the SDG Target if they wish.

5. Indicators: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator/Manager to link the SDG Target to any of the indicators stored. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator/Manager can choose to add a new indicator from here to link to the SDG Target if they wish.

6. Status: Automatically set to draft, the Administrator/Manager can change this to public once the SDG target is ready to be published on the public site. The status of SDG targets can also be changed in bulk using the filtering system on the SDG Target page (see below)

7. Categories: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator/Manager to link the SDG target to any of the SDGs

8. Cancel/Save: This is where the Administrator/Manager can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button

#### Editing SDG Targets

There are also two ways in which SDG can be edited;

* edit individually (See below)
* batch edit (see [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md))

##### Individual editing

Individual editing is as simple as finding the SDG Target you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the SDG Target title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button (circled):

Clicking the edit button allows the Administrator/Manager to edit all of the fields associated with that SDG Target including:

* Editing the title, reference and description
* Adding/editing the actions the SDG Target is linked to
* Adding/editing the indicators the SDG Target is linked to
* Editing the draft/public status of the SDG Target
* Adding/editing the SDG the target is linked to
* Deleting the SDG Target
