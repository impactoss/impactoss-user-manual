### Manage Actions

Administrators and Managers can 'add or edit' data via the Actions page.

#### Adding Actions

There are two ways for an Administrator to add actions:

1. Add single actions (see below)
2. Import a file of multiple actions (see [Import content](/managers/import.md))

Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page (pictured above).

1. Title: Short title of action

2. Description: Additional details of action

3. Recommendations: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the recommendations contained within the database. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new recommendation from here to link to the Action if they wish.

4. SDG Targets: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator to link the Action to any of the SDG targets. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator can choose to add a new SDG Target from here to link to the Action if they wish.

#### Editing Actions

There are also two ways in which Actions can be edited;

* edit individually (See below)
* batch edit (see [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md))

##### Individual editing

Individual editing is as simple as finding the action you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the action title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button (circled):
