#### Adding New Actions

There are two ways for authorised users to add actions:

1. Add single actions (see below)
2. Import a file of multiple actions (see [Import multiple items](/managers/import.md))

Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page (pictured above).

##### Adding a single Action:

On the 'New Action View' (see screenshot above), enter the following information:

1. **Title**: Action title
2. **Description**: Additional details of Action. Text styling can be applied using markdown (see http://commonmark.org/help).
3. **Recommendations**: Clicking on the drop down menu allows you to link the Action to any of the Recommendations contained within the database. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where you can choose to add a new Recommendation from here to link to the Action if you wish.
4. **SDG Targets** (if configured): like 3.
5. **Indicators**: like 3.
6. **Status**: By default initially set to **Draft**, you can change this to **Public** once the Action is ready to be published on the public site. _Note: The publication status of Actions can also be changed using [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md)_
7. **Target date**: The target date for completion of the activity
8. **Target date comment**: Any relevant comments regarding the target date (optional)
9. **Thematic cluster** (depends on configuration): Clicking on the drop down menu allows you to link the Action to any of the pre-existing Thematic Clusters. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where you can choose to add a new Thematic Cluster from here to link to the Action you wish. See also [Explore by Category](/visitors/categories.md).
10. **Organisation** (depends on configuration): like 9.
11. **Save**: This is where you can save all of the details that have been entered (or clear the form using the cancel button)
