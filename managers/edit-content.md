### Edit single item

> _Available for: ([Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

The database is made up of information entered into it by the State and is designed so that it is flexible and can be used in a way that meets the needs of any country. All of the information and categorisations are totally flexible and can be created and edited as needed. The following can be classified as entities within the database:

* Categories (human rights body, reporting cycle, human rights issue, affected persons, thematic clusters, organisations, SDGs)
* Actions
* Indicators
* Recommendations
* SDG Targets

> To edit or addentities you need to be assigned as an 'Administrator' or 'Manager' after you register as a user. See [Manage & Promote Users](/managers/users-admin.md)

Also see [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md)

#### Editing a Single Entity

_Example: Editing an affected person category_

First the Administrator needs to navigate to where their entity can be found. To edit any category (as listed above) the Administrator needs (1 below) to click on the 'Categories' link in the top menu bar and then (2) click on the relevant taxonomy. Clicking on any of the categories (3), such as 'Children', brings up the second image below, from where the Administrator can go in to edit the entity and all associations it has (e.g. linked recommendations, actions, etc.):

![](/assets/m-category-overview.png)

![](/assets/m-category-edit.png)

The same approach is required to any action, indicator, recommendation or SDG target - simply find the entity in question, click on it and hit the 'edit' button to get going.

For more detailed instructions on how to edit please see the relevant sections for [categories](/managers/categories.md), [actions](/managers/actions.md), [indicators](/managers/indicators.md), [recommendations ](/managers/recommendations.md)and [SDG targets](/managers/sdg-targets.md).
