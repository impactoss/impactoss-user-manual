### Create National Implementation Plan

> _Available for: [Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md)_

The National Implementation Plan consists of the obligations of the State in relation to human rights and the SDGs. It also contains the actions the Government is planning to do to implement those obligations and contains the data of progress achieved to date. A National Plan can be created for either human rights or the SDGs, or both.  

The obligations, which form the basis of the National Implementation Plan, can be SDG targets, human rights recommendations received from the Universal Periodic Review, Treaty Body Committees, the Special Procedures or the substantive articles of the Treaties themselves. These are often overlapping in nature so the application helps the user to create a National Implementation Plan where all linkages are identified, eliminating duplication of reporting, helping to foster a coordinated implementation approach and to identify any gaps from the outset. If a national Implementation Plan is developed for both human rights and the SDGs any crossover can also be identified and duplication of efforts reduced yet further.

Once the National Implementation Plan has been developed, users of the application will add regular progress reports and anyone will be able to track how well implementation is progressing.

Below we will explain how to create the National Action Implementation Plan and finally also highlight how you can set up an SDG Implementation Plan.

#### Creating Your Human Rights Action Implementation Plan in 4 Steps

##### 1. Enter Human Rights Recommendations

From the [Recommendations List](/visitors/recommendations.md) you can either import multiple recommendations or observations in bulk or add them one by one. For more information on adding recommendations and observations see

* [Manage Recommendations](/managers/recommendations.md)
* [Import multiple items](/managers/import.md)

##### 2. Cluster your recommendations and articles

By creating recommendation clusters and themes the wide ranging obligations become more manageable and easier to track.

The most efficient way to cluster Recommendations is to use a combination of

* **list filtering** (see (1) in screenshot below) to find similar obligations (see [Lists: filter items](/visitors/lists-filter.md)) and
* **batch editing** of selected (see (2) below) obligations ([Batch edit multiple items](/managers/batch-edit.md))

Alternatively, **Recommendations can be allocated to Clusters individually** (or Clusters to Recommendations if you prefer) as described here: [Edit single item](/managers/edit-content.md)

##### 3. Add Actions and Indicators

Now that the obligations for the National Implementation Plan have been entered and clustered, you will need to add Actions (and associated indicators) to effectively address the obligations. Like Recommendations, Actions and Indicators can also be added individually or by importing multiple entries at once from the [Action List](/visitors/actions.md) and [Indicator List](/visitors/indicators.md) respectively. For more information on adding them see

* [Manage Actions](/managers/actions.md)
* [Manage Indicators](/managers/indicators.md)
* [Import multiple items](/managers/import.md)

> Note: you can create action indicators while creating a single action as part of the same process

Whilst multiple indicators can be imported it is important to edit each one individually as this is where responsibility for an indicator can be allocated to a user and its reporting schedule defined (again see [Manage Indicators](/managers/indicators.md)).

##### 4. Assign Actions to Recommendations

Once added and defined, Actions can be assigned to assigned to relevant Recommendation Clusters or individual Recommendations using a combination of

* **list filtering** (1) to find similar obligations (see [Lists: filter items](/visitors/lists-filter.md)) and
* **batch editing** of selected (2) obligations ([Batch edit multiple items](/managers/batch-edit.md))

Alternatively, **Action can be assigned to Clusters and Recommendations individually** (or vice versa) as described here: [Edit single item](/managers/edit-content.md)

##### Finally: Monitor and update

The Implementation Plan is never finished! States will continue to receive additional recommendations from the Treaty Body Committees, the UPR and the Special Procedures. Once any new recommendations are received then these need to be entered into the database, assigned to existing or new clusters and actions assigned to them to make sure they are addressed. For more details see

* [Monitor Implementation Plan](/managers/monitor-implementation-plan.md)
* [Oversee Reporting](/managers/oversee-reporting.md)

#### The SDG Implementation Plan

The SDG Implementation Plan works in exactly the same way as the Action Implementation Plan except that Targets are already clustered by SDGs (step 2). Another exception is that for each SDG Targets the UN has defined specific SDG Target Indicators that we can also link with any Actions that address specific SDG Targets:

```
SDG 1 ---- SDG Target 1.1 ----------------- SDG Indicator 1.1.1
                           \            /
                            - Action 2 ---- Progress Indicator 2.1
```

If a State is using the platform for both human rights and SDG reporting then as soon as they have finished developing one then work has already started on the other, as actions can been linked across the two plans.

```
Mechanism ---- Recommendation 1 ---- Action 1 ---- Indicator 1.1
                                  /            \
SDG 1 -------- SDG Target 1.1 -------------------- SDG Indicator 1.1.1

```
