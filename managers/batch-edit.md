### Batch edit multiple items

#### 'Edit' v 'Filter' Mode

'Filter' mode is available to all users and visitors and allows for actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets to be filtered by [category, connected category, connection or status](/glossary.md).

As soon as an Administrator or Manager is logged in this view changes to:

![](/assets/Filter 2.png)

1. The filter list now becomes a filter or edit list, with filter selected as the default (coloured orange)

2. Options to select the page of results or individual results now also appear.

As soon as any of the results are selected by the user the mode will automatically switch from 'filter' to 'edit'

Once the Administrator or Manager is in 'Edit' mode they can update the selected entries (either Actions, Indicators, Recommendations or SDG Targets) and change the entry associations (e.g. the category tags, actions, indicators, thematic cluster). This allows the Administrator to edit entries in bulk. The full details of what is possible for each type of entry is discussed in the chapters below and is only applicable to Administrators and Managers.


**'Edit' v 'Filter' Mode**

'Filter' mode is available to all registered users and visitors and allows for actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets to be filtered by [category, connected category, connection or status](/glossary.md).

The edit function is available only to **Administrators and Managers.**

1. Once an Administrator or Manager is signed in the filter list now becomes a filter or edit list, with filter selected as the default (coloured orange)

2. Options to select the page of results or individual results now also appear.

As soon as any of the results are selected by the user the mode will automatically switch from 'filter' to 'edit'

Once the Administrator or Manager is in 'Edit' mode they can update the selected entries (either Actions, Indicators, Recommendations or SDG Targets) and change the entry associations (e.g. the category tags, actions, indicators, thematic cluster). This allows the Administrator or Manager to edit entries in bulk.

To edit any entity an Administrator or Manager can simply click on the entity they wish to edit at any time, on any of the pages of the application. Clicking on the entity will bring up the full details and an 'edit' button.

Batch editing of actions (or other entities such as recommendations, indicators or SDG targets) is a powerful feature that allows Administrators to efficiently edit actions in a variety of ways including:

* By setting the status of multiple actions from draft to public
* By linking multiple actions with any category (i.e. a thematic cluster or organisation)
* By linking multiple actions with any connected category (i.e. human rights body, cycle, issue, affected persons or SDG)
* By linking multiple actions with any connection (i.e. Indicators, recommendations or SDG targets)

Batch editing is a simple process - first the Administrator needs to identify and select the actions they wish to batch edit and then secondly they update the selected actions as they wish.

1. The Administrator can select the actions they wish by first using the filtering and search functions to bring up the relevant actions on their screen. More information on how to use these functions can be found [here](/visitors/actions.md). Once the relevant actions have been identified the Administrator can either:

  * Select individual actions using the checkbox next to each action (see \#1 on image below)
  * Select all actions on the page displayed (see \#2 on image below)
  * Select all actions returned by the search and filtering results if they do not fit onto a single display page (see \#3 on image below)

2. Once the relevant actions have been selected the Administrator can then use the menu on left hand side of the screen to link the selected actions to any category, connected category or connection. For example, if the selected actions were to be linked to a particular thematic cluster the Administrator would click on the thematic cluster title in the left hand menu bar and the box 1 below will appear. Box 2 shows what happens when the Administrator selects the thematic cluster they wish to link to the actions:

![](/assets/Batch edit actions.png)

1. The Administrator can use the filter box to search for the thematic cluster (or category/sub-category/connection) they wish to find

2. Where some, but not all of the selected actions are already linked to a thematic cluster the Administrator is shown a box with a horizontal line. By clicking once on any of these boxes (so that a tick appears) and then 'Update' the Administrator could update the thematic cluster to either be linked with **all** of the selected actions. By clicking on the box twice (so that the box is empty) and then 'Update' the Administrator can **unlink** all of the selected actions from that thematic cluster.

3. Where a thematic cluster is not currently linked to any of the selected actions the Administrator is shown a blank box. By clicking once in any of these boxes (so that a tick appears) and then 'Update' the Administrator could update the thematic cluster to either be linked with **all** of the selected actions. In this example, the box on the right demonstrates how this works if the Administrator selects 'CRPD Implementation'

4. If a thematic cluster does not exist which the Administrator wishes to link all of the selected actions to they can create one using this button

5. At the top of the list is a summary of how many thematic clusters are already linked to all or some of the actions. By clicking once on this box (so that a tick appears) and then 'Update' the Administrator can link **all** of the selected actions to **all **of the thematic clusters**. By clicking on the box twice (so that it is blank) and then 'Update' the Administrator can unlink all of the selected actions from all of the thematic clusters.

6. When a thematic cluster is selected then a tick will appear in the box

7. The 'Update' button will only be active once the Administrator has made one of the changes described above. Clicking on the update button will save those changes. This may take several seconds if editing a large number of actions at once.



**Batch editing**

Batch editing is a powerful function of the application as it allows Administrators or Managers to update multiple entities in a single move, saving considerable time and effort.

Batch editing can be carried out in relation to actions, indicators, recommendations and SDG targets, but not categories. It allows an Administrator or Manager to update multiple entities at once in any of the following ways:

* Add multiple actions or indicators to a thematic cluster
* Assign multiple actions or indicators to an organisation
* Assign multiple indicators to an SDG
* Tag multiple actions or recommendations with any connected category (human rights body, cycle, human rights issue, affected persons, SDGs)
* Link multiple actions or indicators to any connection (action,indicator, recommendation or SDG target)
* Link multiple recommendations to actions
* Change the draft/public status of multiple actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets
* Change or denote the Government response to multiple UPR recommendations

The batch edit function works in the same manner for all of the above use cases and is demonstrated below.

First the Administrator or Manager needs to identify and select the actions they wish to batch edit and then secondly they update the selected actions as they wish.

1. The Administrator or Manager can select the actions they wish by first using the filtering and search functions to bring up the relevant actions on their screen. More information on how to use these functions can be found [here](/visitors/actions.md). Once the relevant actions have been identified the Administrator or Manager can either:

  * Select individual actions using the checkbox next to each action (see \#1 on image below)
  * Select all actions on the page displayed (see \#2 on image below)
  * Select all actions returned by the search and filtering results if they do not fit onto a single display page (see \#3 on image below)

Once the relevant actions have been selected the Administrator or Manager can then use the menu on left hand side of the screen to link the selected actions to any category, connected category or connection. For example, if the selected actions were to be linked to a particular thematic cluster the Administrator or Manager would click on the thematic cluster title in the left hand menu bar and the box 1 below will appear.

7. The 'Update' button will only be active once the Administrator or Manager has made one of the changes described above. Clicking on the update button will save those changes. This may take several seconds if editing a large number of actions at once.
