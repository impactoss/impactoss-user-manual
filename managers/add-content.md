### Add single item

> _Available for: ([Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

Also see [Import content](/managers/import.md)

Adding new entities is very straight forward. The Administrator or Manager simply needs to navigate to the page relevant to the entity they wish to create. I.e. either categories, actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets. On each of these pages is an 'add' button placed in the top right hand corner of the content frame. On all of the pages other than the categories page there is also an 'import' button.
