### Manage Recommendations

> _Available for: [Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md)_

Administrators and Managers can 'add or edit' data via the Recommendations page.

#### Adding Recommendations

There are two ways for an Administrator to add recommendations:

1. Add single recommendations (see below)
2. Import a file of multiple recommendations (see [Import content](/managers/import.md))

Both methods of adding actions can be accessed via the buttons in the top right hand corner of the actions page (pictured above).

##### Adding a single recommendation:

Click on the 'Add Recommendation' icon and the following form will appear:

![](/assets/m-recommedation-add-new.png)

1. ID: Administrator/Manager can add a recommendation ID. This should be the reference given by the relevant UN body. If left blank an ID will automatically be assigned.

2. Title: Short title of recommendation

3. Government response: Only applicable to UPR recommendations, which a Government can 'accept' or 'note'. The response for UPR recommendations should be recorded here

4. Government response comment: When Government's 'note' comments they often explain why they are not accepting them. Details of such reasoning should be recorded here.

5. Actions: Clicking on the drop down menu allows the Administrator/Manager to link the recommendation to any of the actions stored. At the bottom of the drop down menu is also an 'Add' button where the Administrator/Manager can choose to add a new action from here to link to the recommendation if they wish.

6. Status: Automatically set to draft, the Administrator/Manager can change this to public once the recommendation is ready to be published on the public site. The status of recommendations can also be changed in bulk using the filtering system on the recommendation page (see below)

7. Human rights body: The Administrator/Manager can click on the drop down menu to select which human rights body the recommendation came from. If the human rights body does not already exist they can click on the 'add' button to add a new body.

8. Cycle: The Administrator/Manager can click on the drop down menu to select which reporting cycle the recommendation came from (e.g. Samoa's 2nd CEDAW review, or 3rd UPR). If the cycle does not already exist they can click on the 'add' button to add a new cycle.

9. Human rights issue: The Administrator/Manager can click on the drop down menu to select which human rights issue the recommendation relates to. The Administrator can select as many issues as are relevant for that recommendation. Alternatively the Administrator/Manager can do this using the batch edit feature (see below for more details)

10. Affected persons: The Administrator/Manager can click on the drop down menu to select which affected persons the recommendation relates to. The Administrator can select as many issues as are relevant for that recommendation. Alternatively the Administrator/Manager can do this using the batch edit feature (see below for more details)

11. Thematic cluster: The Administrator/Manager can click on the drop down menu to select which thematic cluster the recommendation belongs to. The Administrator/Manager can select as many thematic clusters as are relevant for that recommendation. Alternatively the Administrator/Manager can do this using the batch edit feature (see below for more details). The Administrator/Manager can also create a new thematic cluster using the 'add' button if a relevant thematic cluster does not yet exist.

12. Cancel/Save: This is where the Administrator/Manager can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button

#### Editing Recommendations

There are also two ways in which Recommendations can be edited;

* edit individually (see below)
* batch edit (see [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md))

##### Individual editing

Individual editing is as simple as finding the recommendation you wish to edit, using the search and filtering functions and clicking on the recommendation title in question, which brings up the following screen with an Edit button (circled):

Clicking the edit button allows the Administrator/Manager to edit all of the fields associated with that recommendation including:

* Editing the title and Government response
* Adding/editing the actions the recommendation is linked to
* Adding/editing the thematic clusters the recommendation is linked to
* Editing the draft/public status of the recommendation
* Adding/editing the categories the recommendation is tagged with
* Deleting the recommendation
