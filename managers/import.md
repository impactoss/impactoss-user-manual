### Import multiple items

> _Available for: ([Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

By clicking on the 'Import' button (top image) the Administrator will be provided with a CSV template download (see image below) for batch importing multiple Actions. Once in the required format the Administrator can click on the 'Select File' button and upload their file and all of the Actions will automatically be imported.

> When importing recommendations it is only possible to import Title, Reference, Accepted Status and Accepted Response. Linking to thematic clusters, assigning human rights body and cycle, etc. still has to be executed either using the batch edit function (below) or individually (as above)


A time-efficient way to add new actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets is to use the 'import' function to import multiple entities in one go. The process for importing is the same for the different types of entity. First, the Administrator or Manager clicks on the import button as shown above on the relevant entity page - the following box will then appear:

1. Clicking on this link allows the Administrator or Manager to download a CSV template for importing multiple entities. If the template structure is not used then the batch import will not work. The Administrator or Manager should download the template, copy and paste their data into this file and then save it using an appropriate file name.

2. Once step 1 has been completed the Administrator or Manager clicks on the 'select file' button and chooses the file from their computer. The batch import will then commence and a progress bar will appear until the upload is complete. The entities will now appear in the database.


Key Fact: When batch importing, it is only possible to import the following:

* For actions: title, description, target date, target date comment
* For indicators: title, reference, description
* For recommendations: title, reference, government response
* SDG target: title, reference, description

It is not possible to assign entities to categories, tag with connected categories, link to connections or assign draft/public status. This can be done when adding individual entities but not importing multiple entities. Instead, the Administrator should use the batch edit function (see above) to assign, tag and link immediately after importing._
