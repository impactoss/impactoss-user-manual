#### Setting Up Indicator Managers

Setting up an Indicator Owner means assigning responsibility for a particular indicator to a registered user. That user will then be receive the automated report reminder emails and be responsible for uploading the report and data. This can only be done by Managers and Administrators.

For an Indicator Manager to be assigned, the person in question must first be a registered user. If they are not the Administrator must contact them and request they register. Details on how to register can be found [here](/howto/register.md). Once the person is a registered user the process is as follows:

1. The registered user role must be changed from 'no role assigned' to 'contributor'. To do so the Administrator needs to navigate to the 'Users' page and update their role. Full details on how to do so can be found [here](/members/users-admin.md).

2. The Administrator must then find the indicator they wish to assign to the registered user. The quickest way to do this is via the 'Indicators' tab in the top menu bar and using the search and filter functions. Clicking on the indicator will allow the Administrator to choose to edit the indicator and once editing they can assign it to the desired registered user using the drop down menu and recording when reports should be uploaded. Full details on adding and editing indicators can be found [here](/members/indicators.md).


#### Reviewing Reports as a Manager

Once a report is submitted by a Contributor the registered user the relevant [Manager](/members/user-roles.md) will receive an automated email informing them. The email notification will contain a link to the report - once the Manager has signed in they will be taken to the report to review the contents. To accept the contents of the report and make it public the Manager should change the status from 'draft' to 'public'.
