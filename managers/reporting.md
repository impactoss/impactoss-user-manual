### Reporting as Manager

> _Available for: ([Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

Adding progress reports is critical to the success of using this tool. Progress reports contain the data required for each indicator of the National Implementation Plan. This regular entry of data allows States, civil society and other stakeholders to check progress of the Plan and ensures that required reporting is just a matter of analysing the data and writing the narrative.

Data can be entered through progress reports by civil servants, administrators of the database or civil society and other stakeholders.

##### Prerequisites

* Registered ([Register](/visitors/register.md))
* Promoted to Contributor ([Get Promoted](guests/promotion.md))
* Assigned to indicator(by user with at least role "Manager" (see [Oversee Reporting](managers/oversee-reporting.md))

Each indicator in the Implementation Plan is assigned to an who is responsible for uploading the relevant information, either as a once off or on a regular basis. That Indicator Manager will receive an automated email when the information is due.

Once an email reminder hass been received the Indicator Manager simply needs to:

1. Click on the link in the email (not pictured)

2. Enter login details (if not already signed in)

3. Filter the indicators using the 'My Indicators' option and click on the relevant indicator

4. Click on 'Add Report' (1 or 2 in screenshot below)

The Indicator Manager will then be taken to the following screen:

The Indicator Manager simply needs to fill out the required fields:

1. Title: The title of the progress report (E.g. 'Domestic violence stats Q3 2017' or 'NHRI CEDAW Training Workshop for Police Recruits'

2. Description: Full details of the progress report

3. Upload document: Information/data related to the indicator should be uploaded via this link

4. Public/Private: The status of the uploaded document can be set to public or private
depending on whether there is sensitive information contained within that should not be available publicly

5. Draft/public: The status of the progress report. Once it is ready to publish on the public site, this status should be immediately changed to public.

6. Due date: As an administrator, both scheduled and unscheduled progress reports can be entered. The Administrator is required to indicate here whether the progress report they are uploading is unscheduled or scheduled.

7. Save/cancel: This is where the Administrator can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button


###### Example

![](/assets/Implementation Plan.png)
_**All information demonstrated is for illustrative purposes only **_

The image above demonstrates what actions, indicators and look like in the Implementation Plan. In the example highlighted, two indicators have been set for the Action (training for judges, prosecutors and MJCA). The final column demonstrates when the information relating to those indicators is due. On that date the user who has been assigned to these indicators - in this case likely the training facilitator - will receive an email with a link requesting that they upload the information for each.

Should they fail to do so then they will continue to receive email reminders until the data has been uploaded. This is the first safeguard against non-entry built into the application. Data can be uploaded in any file type format.
