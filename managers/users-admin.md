### Manage and promote users

> _Available for: [Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md)_

On the Users page Administrators and Managers can manage all of the registered users and perform the following functions:

* Edit existing users (details, user type, delete)
* Assign users to a particular organisation (if configured), individually or by [Batch editing](/managers/batch-edit.md))
* Promote a user

##### Update existing Users

To edit existing users, or to reset a password the Administrator simply needs to find the relevant user using the search and filter functions and click on their name. This will bring up the following screen:

![](/assets/m-user-profile.png)

The 'Change Password' link will allow the Administrator to reset that user's password. Please notify the user of the password change and ask them to login to their account as soon as possible and reset it themselves so that their account remains secure.

Clicking on the 'Edit' link will allow the Administrator to edit all of the User details including:

* User name
* Registered email address
* User role
* Organisation of user

##### Assign users to an organisation (if configured)

Through the 'Users' tab, the Administrator can assign user to a particular organisation (i.e. record which organisation they work for/represent). This can either be done individually by editing the user profile as described above, or through batch editing.

##### Promote a user (assign a user role)

      1. The registered user role must be changed from 'no role assigned' to 'contributor'. To do so the Administrator needs to navigate to the 'Users' page and update their role. Full details on how to do so can be found [here](/members/users-admin.md).

When a person first registers on the site they are a guest user and assigned no role. It is up to either a Manager or an Administrator to assign user roles. The following types of promotion can be carried out:

* Promote a guest user to Indicator Manager
* Promote guest users or Indicator Managers to the role of Manager
* Promote guest users, Indicator Managers or Managers to the role of Administrator (only carried out by Administrators)

To promote a user the Manager or Administrator should navigate to the 'Users' page on the top menu bar. They can then locate the user they wish to promote using either the search bar (entering their name) or the filtering options (selecting the organisation for whom they work). Clicking on the 'edit' button will bring up the following control box:

Clicking on the user role drop down menu (circled) brings up the following options:

![](/assets/m-role.png)

The new role can be selected and the save button pressed to confirm the promotion.
