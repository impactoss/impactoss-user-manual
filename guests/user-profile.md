### Update user Profile

> _Available for: [Guests](/guests/guest.md), as well as all authorised users ([Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), [Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

Once logged in, all users will have a 'User Profile' link showing your name in the top right hand corner of their screen on all pages (see picture below). Clicking on this allows the user to edit their account details, including updating their password, by clicking on the 'edit' link in the top right hand corner of the content frame.
