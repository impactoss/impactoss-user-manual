### Reporting as a Guest

> _Available for: [Guests](/guests/guest.md). Contributors please refer to ([Reporting as Contributor](/contributors/reporting.md) and Managers and Administrators please see [Reporting as Manager](/managers/reporting.md))_

Adding progress reports is critical to the success of using this tool. Progress reports contain the data required for each indicator of the National Implementation Plan. This regular entry of data allows States, civil society and other stakeholders to check progress of the Plan and ensures that required reporting is just a matter of analysing the data and writing the narrative.

Data can be entered through progress reports by civil servants, administrators of the database or civil society and other stakeholders.


#### Reporting as a Guest (Civil Society and Individuals)

Contributors are registered users who can submit information relating to the National Implementation Plan or the SDGs, but don't have to be part of the Government. NGOs, NHRIs or any member of the public can thus contribute data to show progress towards any part of the National Implementation Plan or SDGs. This gives groups and individuals a platform to showcase their work to Government and to encourage more coordinated activities. For instance, a contributor could be an NGO who has been doing work in a particular area that is helping to achieve one of the areas of the Implementation Plan or the SDGs. Any organisation or individual can register as a user and contribute data as they see fit. In addition to raising awareness of the work they are doing this can also help to foster better coordination of activities with Government.

 > Note: progress reports will have to be reviewed and published first by an authorised user to become public


Anyone is able to submit information via the application if they think it is relevant to a particular area of human rights or the SDGs. To do so you must first register as a user. Details on how to do so can be found [here](/howto/register.md).

Secondly, and once logged in, you must navigate to the relevant indicator using the search or filtering functions. More details on using those functions can be found [here](/howto/filter-and-search.md).

Once the relevant indicator has been found the contributor simply needs to click on the 'Add report' button' as described above for Indicator Managers and follow the same set of instructions.

> Reports submitted in this way will not automatically appear on the site. They will first be reviewed by a Manager and once approved will appear
