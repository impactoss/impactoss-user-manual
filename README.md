#### Sadata User Manual

The Sadata user manual is a simple guide for all types of users of this software. It is written using GitBook to allow for revisions as the software evolves and for users to download as a pdf. 

The manual is a [documentation file](https://github.com/nmrf/sadata-user-manual/blob/master/LICENSE.md) of the [Sadata Open Source Software](https://github.com/nmrf/sadata/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and draws upon relevant content from the IMPACT OSS manual permitted under its MIT licence. 

#### Who is Sadata for?

Sadata was developed at the request of the Government of Samoa to help them track implementation of their human rights obligations and the SDGs. The Government established an inter-Ministerial National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-Up \(NMRF\) with responsibility for the implementation and reporting of all Samoa's human rights obligations. Sadata is a tool designed to support the work of the NMRF.

However, Sadata is more than just a database for Government. It is a tool for civil society, international organisations and individuals. It is a platform to ensure greater oversight and accountability of Government and for greater collaboration and partnerships.
