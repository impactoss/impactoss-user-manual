#### Principal Implementation Plan Entities

##### Recommendations

![](/assets/recommendations_icon.png)  ![Accepted](/assets/recAccepted_icon.png) ![Not accepted](/assets/recNotAccepted_icon.png)  
_Recommendation \| Accepted \| Not accepted_

States receive Recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review, the UN Committees of the Treaties it has ratified and the Special Procedures. These Recommendations are entered into the application and are clustered to form the basis of the National Implementation

---

##### Actions

![](/assets/actions_icon.png)

Actions are what the State says it is going to do to address **Thematic Clusters** \(see below\) of **Recommendations **and implement those obligations

---

##### SDG Targets

![](/assets/7_sdgs.png)

One or more SDG Targets have been defined for each **Sustainable Development Goal** \(SDG, see below\).

---

##### Indicators

![](/assets/indicators_icon.png)

For each **Action** there will be at least one indicator, which describes how the success of that **Action** will be measured. Indicators have also been defined for **SDG Targets**

---

##### Progress reports

![](/assets/report_icon.png)

When an **Indicator** is created within the application a date is set for when the information/data is due. This could be a one off or an ongoing process \(e.g. quarterly crime statistics\). When information is due the Indicator Owner will receive an automate email to upload the required data. This is called a progress report.

---

#### Taxonomies

Taxonomies are groups of categories that allow to classify and cluster the principal Implementation Plan entities \(see above\)

##### Thematic Clusters

![](/assets/SMART_icon.png)

Thematic Clusters are groups of **Recommendations** that make the National Implementation Plan more manageable. For instance, if **Recommendations** were received on the same topic from the UPR and CRC Committee they can be put into one thematic cluster and dealt with together, eliminating duplication and taking a coordinated approach to implementation

---

##### Human Rights Bodies

![](/assets/1_humanRightsBody.png)

Human Rights Bodies, incl. Treaty bodies, refers to the Committees which issue recommendations to States on how to meet their human rights obligations. This taxonomy also includes the Universal Periodic Review and Special Procedures. Recommendations within the application are tagged with the relevant treaty body so users can easily see where they came from.

---

##### Cycles

![](/assets/2_UNsession.png)

Each **Human Rights Body** Committee reviews the State on a regular basis. The cycle allows users of the application to easily see which cycle the recommendations relate to.
