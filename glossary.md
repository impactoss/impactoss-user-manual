_**General**_

National Implementation Plan: _The National Implementation Plan consists of the obligations of the State in relation to human rights and the SDGs. It also contains the actions the Government is planning to do to implement those obligations and contains the data of progress achieved to date._

National Mechanism for Implementation, Reporting and Follow-Up: _Government body responsible for coordinating all human rights implementation and reporting. May also contain representatives from civil society, NHRIs, judiciary, Parliamentarians, private sector_



_**Types of User**_

Visitor: _Any member of the public visiting the site. Visitors can access and explore all information\* using the filters and search functions and track progress on the National Implementation Plan_

Contributor: _NGOs, NHRIs or any member of the public can register as a user and upload data they may have showing progress towards any part of the National Implementation Plan or SDGs. This gives groups and individuals a platform to showcase their work to Government and to encourage more coordinated activities _

Indicator Owner: _For each indicator in the National Implementation Plan, one registered user will be assigned the owner. That person will have been identified as holding the information required for that indicator. They will receive an automated email at the right time asking them to upload that information_

Manager: _For each area of the National Implementation Plan \(e.g. UPR recommendations, CRC recommendations, SDGs, etc.\) there will be a Manager assigned. If an Indicator Owner does not upload the information required of them at the presecribed time the Manager will receive an automated alert and it is their role to follow-up on the non-entry of data. _

Administrator: _Administrators have the power to add and edit everything within the application. They are responsible for developing and updating the National Implementation Plan, assigning Indicator Owners and adding data where required. _



_**Implementation Plan**_

Recommendations: _States receive recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review, the UN Committees of the Treaties it has ratified and the Special Procedures. These recommendations are entered into the application and are clustered to form the basis of the National Implementation Plan_

Thematic Cluster: _Thematic clusters are groups of recommendations that make the National Implementation Plan more manageable. For instance, if recommendations were received on the same topic from the UPR and CRC Committee they can be put into one thematic cluster and dealt with together, eliminating duplication and taking a coordinated approach to implementation_

Action: _Actions are what the State says it is going to do to address clusters of recommendations and implement those obligations_

Indicator: _For each action there will be at least one indicator, which describes how the success of that action will be measured_

Progress report: _When an indicator is created within the application a date is set for when the information/data is due. This could be a one off or an ongoing process \(e.g. quarterly crime statistics\). When information is due the Indicator Owner will receive an automate email to upload the required data. This is called a progress report. _
