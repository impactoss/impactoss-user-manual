_**Implementation Plan**_

Recommendations: _States receive recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review, the UN Committees of the Treaties it has ratified and the Special Procedures. These recommendations are entered into the application and are clustered to form the basis of the National Implementation Plan_

Thematic Cluster: _Thematic clusters are groups of recommendations that make the National Implementation Plan more manageable. For instance, if recommendations were received on the same topic from the UPR and CRC Committee they can be put into one thematic cluster and dealt with together, eliminating duplication and taking a coordinated approach to implementation_

Action: _Actions are what the State says it is going to do to address clusters of recommendations and implement those obligations_

Indicator: _For each action there will be at least one indicator, which describes how the success of that action will be measured_

Progress report: _When an indicator is created within the application a date is set for when the information/data is due. This could be a one off or an ongoing process \(e.g. quarterly crime statistics\). When information is due the Indicator Owner will receive an automate email to upload the required data. This is called a progress report. _

_**Taxonomies**_

Treaty Bodies: _Treaty bodies refers to the Committees which issue recommendations to States on how to meet their human rights obligations.
