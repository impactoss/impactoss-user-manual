\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering as described above only allows the user to contribute draft progress reports to indicators as a Guest Contributor \(TODO link\). To publish and edit other information, specific user permission rights_ have to be granted by an Administrator or Manager \(see _\[\_Assign user roles_\]\(/getting-started-quick-start/manage-users.md\)_\) \*\*_
