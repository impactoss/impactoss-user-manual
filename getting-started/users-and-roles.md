#### Users, Roles and Registration

Sadata is a tool which allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way Sadata collects information and tracks implementation.

##### Registration

Users have to be registered in the following way:

1. The person who wishes to be registered needs to click on the 'Register' link in the top right hand corner of any page within Sadata, as circled above. 
2. The person will then be asked to complete a registration form, entering their name, email address and a confirmed password \(see image below\)

3. Once completed that person will now be a registered Sadata User.

\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering on Sadata as described above does not grant that user permission rights to upload information that will automatically appear, or to make access the back-end of the website. For that to happen an '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'  must either make that user responsible for the collection of data for one or more indicators \(thus becoming a '_[_Contributor_](#contributors)_'\) or they must change that users role to either '_[_Manager_](#managers)_' or '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'. \*\*_
