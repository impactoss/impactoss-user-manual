\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering as described above only allows the user to contribute draft progress reports to indicators as a Guest Contributor. To publish and edit other information, specific _user permission rights_ have to be granted by an Administrator or Manager \(see _[_Assign user roles_](/getting-started-quick-start/manage-users.md)_\) \*\*_
