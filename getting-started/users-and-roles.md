#### Users, Roles and Registration

Sadata is a tool which allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way Sadata collects information and tracks implementation.

##### Registration

Users have to be registered in the following way:

1. The person who wishes to be registered needs to click on the 'Register' link in the top right hand corner of any page within Sadata, as circled above. 
2. The person will then be asked to complete a registration form, entering their name, email address and a confirmed password \(see image below\)

3. Once completed that person will now be a registered Sadata User.

\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering on Sadata as described above does not grant that user permission rights to upload information that will automatically appear, or to make access the back-end of the website. For that to happen an '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'  must either make that user responsible for the collection of data for one or more indicators \(thus becoming a '_[_Contributor_](#contributors)_'\) or they must change that users role to either '_[_Manager_](#managers)_' or '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'. \*\*_

##### Contributors

Contributors are key to the success of data - they are the users who upload information against all of the indicators. A user becomes a contributor when an Administrator allocates one of more indicators to that user. That user then becomes responsible for uploading data at the required time \(set by the Administrator\). The user will receive an email when it is time to upload that information.

_Example Indicator 1:_ _CEDAW Legislative Compliance Review Report. Due October 2018.                                                                               = In October 2018 the assigned User will receive an automated email with a link to upload that required report.  _
