### 2.3 Users, Roles and Registration

This tool allows users to organise human rights recommendations and the SDGs, track implementation and record progress by uploading reports and data. It requires users to do this, usually Government employees. There are different types of users and roles and this section outlines exactly what they are and how they can be registered. These different user types allow for the protection of sensitive information and to control who can make fundamental changes to the way information is collected and implementation is tracked.

##### Registration

Users have to be registered in the following way:

1. The person who wishes to be registered needs to click on the 'Register' link in the top right hand corner of any page, as circled above.
2. The person will then be asked to complete a registration form, entering their name, email address and a confirmed password \(see image below\)

3. Once completed that person will now be a registered User

\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering as described above does not grant that user permission rights to upload information that will automatically appear, or to make access the back-end of the website. For that to happen an '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'  must either make that user responsible for the collection of data for one or more indicators \(thus becoming a '_[_Contributor_](#contributors)_'\) or they must change that users role to either '_[_Manager_](#managers)_' or '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'. \*\*_

##### Contributors

Contributors are key to the success of data - they are the users who upload information against all of the indicators. A user becomes a contributor when an Administrator allocates one of more indicators to that user. That user then becomes responsible for uploading data at the required time \(set by the Administrator\). The user will receive an email when it is time to upload that information.

The image above demonstrates what actions, indicators and look like in the Implementation Plan. In the example highlighted, two indicators have been set for the Action \(training for judges, prosecutors and MJCA\). The final column demonstrates when the information relating to those indicators is due. On that date the user who has been assigned to these indicators - in this case likely the training facilitator - will receive an email with a link requesting that they upload  the information for each.

Should they fail to do so then they will continue to receive email reminders until the data has been uploaded. This is the first safeguard against non-entry built into IMPACT OSS.  Data can be uploaded in any file type format.

##### Category Managers

There may be many contributors but far less Managers, who play an oversight role to ensure that data is entered when required - thus providing the second safeguard against non-entry of data.

For each 'Human Rights Body' category a 'Manager' should be assigned by one of the Administrators. The role of the Manager is to ensure that all data for any indicators relating to their assigned 'Human Rights Body' is entered in a timely manner. If a 'Contributor' for one of these indicators repeatedly fails to enter the required data at the specified time then the Manager will receive an automated email notifying them of this failure. It is then their responsibility to follow up directly with the Contributor to ensure the information is uploaded. If the Contributor still does not upload the required information then the Manager should raise this with the relevant Ministry at the next scheduled meeting of the National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-Up.

The second role of Managers occurs when data/information is submitted by an organisation or member of the public who has not been assigned as a contributor. This may be an NGO who has undertaken work in an area relevant to a particular indicator within the Implementation Plan. It is the role of the Manager to review the information and decide whether it should be published or not. At each NMRF quarterly meeting each Manager should provide an overview of recently added data/information to the Working Group.

##### Administrators

Administrators play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of the application. They are responsible for:

* Assigning contributors and managers to indicators and human rights bodies respectively
* Adding newly received recommendations into the database and assigning them to clusters, as directed by the NMRF
* maintaining and updating the category lists
* Adding new actions and indicators as required
* Maintaining content pages
* Reporting bugs

The role of Administrator is the most wide-ranging of all the roles. This manual goes into detail in all of the areas of responsibility of Administrators and how to undertake all of the functions in Chapter 4 - 'Users'.
