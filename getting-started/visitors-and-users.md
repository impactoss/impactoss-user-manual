Visitors, by comparison, can use Sadata to access all of the information uploaded by 'users' and track implementation progress relating to human rights and the SDGs. Visitors do also have the option to submit information if they think it is relevant via the site, but it will be reviewed by a user before it becomes public. If you are a visitor to the site the following chapter is all you'll need to know everything you need to make the most out of Sadata. If you are a user, following the 'Visitor' chapter the manual goes on to explore the different kind of user roles, takes you through each section of Sadata step by step and explores some common use case scenarios.

Now it's time to turn to the chapter that you need!
