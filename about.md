##  About IMPACT OSS

IMPACT OSS is an Open Source Software (OSS) for Integrated Management and Planning of Actions (IMPACT), created to assist States with coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

IMPACT OSS is based on [Sadata](https://github.com/nmrf/sadata), the platform initially designed and developed by Ashley Bowe and [Unfold Data](http://unfolddata.com) for Samoa's National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up (NMRF), and was enhanced by Unfold Data for the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission](http://hrc.co.nz/) to replace the first version of its interactive [National Plan of Action](http://npa.hrc.co.nz) (also designed and developed by Unfold Data) that to some extent can be considered a conceptual ancestor of Sadata.

#### The Problem

Each State around the world has a huge range of international obligations, in terms of human rights, the Sustainable Development Goals and more. Many of these obligations overlap meaning that one of the SDG targets may be asking a State to do the same thing as one of its UPR recommendations. However, up until now no tool existed to help identify all of those linkages and eliminate the duplication of activities and reporting that can occur as a result. With the birth of this software this is no longer the case.

#### The Solution

[IMPACT OSS](https://impactoss.org/) is a web tool for coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the SDGs. It helps States develop a National Implementation Plan through sophisticated clustering of all obligations and recommendations it has received. Through a series of automated processes it helps to ensure ongoing data collection and guard against non-entry of data, meaning the Implementation Plan progress is always 100% up to date. This allows greater oversight by the public and civil society, and for States to have far greater control over implementation of its obligations - ultimately leading to more effective State implementation and reporting and improvements on the ground for everyday people, every day.

#### The Users

IMPACT OSS is a primarily a tool for States to plan and monitor implementation of its human rights and SDG obligations. However, it has also been built with a wider audience in mind whereby civil society and other stakeholders can access the publicly available database and track progress, holding Government to account and contributing their own data where appropriate.
