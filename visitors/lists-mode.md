### Change list view mode: expanding the Implementation Plan

The National Action Implementation Plan (Action List), as well as Indicator and SDG Target list views, can be viewed in either 'List View' or 'Implementation View'.

#### List View

The default 'List View' gives the user a condensed overview with the a summary of associated Indicators and Progress Reports only.

From the list view you can activate the Implementation View by clicking on 'Implementation View' towards the top right-hand corner of the screen ((1) in screenshot above).

You can alternatively also **drill down one level at a time** by clicking on the respective column headers (2) or nested summary boxes within each column (3).

> Note: minimising expanded columns is only possible using the column headers but not by clicking the nested summary boxes.

#### Implementation View

The 'Implementation View' gives a more detailed view with direct access to any associated Indicators and Progress Reports
