### Change list view mode: expanding the Implementation Plan

The National Action Implementation Plan (Action List), as well as Indicator and SDG Target list views, can be viewed in either 'List View' or 'Implementation View'.

**List View**:

The default 'List View' gives the user a condensed overview with the a summary of associated Indicators and Progress Reports only.

From the list view you can activate the Implementation View either clicking on 'Implementation View' towards the top right-hand corner of the screen (see screenshots). You can also drill down one level at a time by clicking on the respective column headers or summary boxes within each column.

**Implementation View**

The 'Implementation View' gives a more detailed view with direct access to any associated Indicators and Progress Reports
