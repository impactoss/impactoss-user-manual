### Explore Indicators

> _Available for: [Visitors](/visitors/visitor.md) and registered users ([Guests](/guests/guest.md), [Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), [Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

Indicators are the measure of success of whether actions have been completed. For each action there should be at least one indicator and for each indicator progress reports should be uploaded demonstrating success or progress.

#### View Indicator list

The Indicators list works in a very similar manner to the [Actions](/visitors/actions.md) list, except its focus is on the indicators and allows users to search through the all indicators contained within the database.

Please see [Lists: filter, group & more](/visitors/lists.md) for options to customise your list view:
* sorting options,
* filtering options,
* switch to 'Implementation Plan' view mode to reveal all progress details

##### View Progress Reports

To view and select individual Progress Reports click on the progress report number displayed next to each indicator (or alternatively switch to view mode to "Implementation Plan", see [Lists](/visitors/lists.md) for details).

Alterantively you can first select the indicator and then, on the "Single Indicator View" (see below), select the Progress Report.

#### View single Indicator

You can explore a single indicator either from the Indicator List or any associated Action or SDG Target view and list.

On the Single Indicator View (pictured below) you can inspect all information about the indicator, including progress reports, as well as all associated Actions and SDG targets:
