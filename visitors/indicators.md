#### Indicators

Indicators in Sadata are the measure of success of whether actions have been completed. For each action there should be at least one indicator and for each indicator reports/data should be uploaded on the specified date\(s\). The Indicators tab is therefore where users can explore these measures of success and the reports/data uploaded against them - a very powerful source of information for civil society and other interested parties.

The Indicators tab works in a very similar manner to the [Actions](/visitors/actions.md) tab, except its focus is on the indicators and allows users to search through the all contained within Sadata, using the filtering tools described in the previous chapter. ![](/assets/Indicators.png)

#### Indicator Views

Similar to the Actions tab, there are two different views for Indicators - the 'List' view and the 'Implementation' view. Users can select which view they prefer using the link below the bottom right-hand corner of the filtering text box \(see image above or read the [Actions page](/visitors/actions.md) for more details\)

#### Grouping Indicators

Unlike actions, indicators do not have a default grouping already set when you land on the page.

However, the user can still group the indicators within Sadata in the same manner by using the drop down menu found below the filtering text box \(see image above\). For more instructions read the [Actions page](/visitors/actions.md).
