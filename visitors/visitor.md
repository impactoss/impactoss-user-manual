##### Recommendations

![](/assets/recommendations_icon.png)

Each country is party to a number of human rights treaties (e.g Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). For each treaty it has signed it has a range of legal obligations to implement and regularly receives recommendations from the respective Treaty Bodies on specific areas for improvement. Additionally each country undertakes a Universal periodic Review every 4.5 years and has a standing invitation to all United Nations Special Procedures. Out of both of these processes each country receives recommendations for how to implement its human rights obligations too. This tab allows visitors to browse through all of the recommendations a country has received, and to see what the Government is doing to meet its commitments.
