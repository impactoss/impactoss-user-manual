Categories are the ways in which Actions, Recommendations and the SDG Targets (see below) are indexed and classified.

##### Recommendations

![](/assets/icon-recommendations.png)

Each country is party to a number of human rights treaties (e.g Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)). For each treaty it has signed it has a range of legal obligations to implement and regularly receives **Recommendations**, also called observations, from the respective Treaty Bodies on specific areas for improvement.

Additionally each country undertakes a Universal periodic Review (UPR) every 4.5 years and has a standing invitation to all United Nations Special Procedures. Out of both of these processes each country receives recommendations for how to implement its human rights obligations too.

##### Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Targets (optional configuration)
