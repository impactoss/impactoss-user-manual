#### Actions & The Implementation Plan

The 'Actions' page is the heart of Sadata. It contains all of the actions the Government \(and other actors\) have committed to in order to implement Samoa's human rights obligations and the SDGs.

When you first arrive on this page, the default view is to group the actions by both human rights issue and by thematic cluster. This is the National Implementation Plan.![](/assets/Implementation Plan 1.png)
