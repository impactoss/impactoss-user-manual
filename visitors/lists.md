### List view options

> _Available for: [Visitors](/visitors/visitor.md) and registered users ([Guests](/guests/guest.md), [Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), [Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

On any list view, including for [Actions](/visitors/actions.md), [Indicators](/visitors/indicators.md), [Recommendations ](/visitors/recommendations.md), and optionally also [SDG Targets ](/visitors/sdg-targets.md), you can use several features to customise your view:

* **[filter list items](/visitors/lists-filter.md)** by keyword, attribute and/or associated categories and related elements
* **[change view mode](/visitors/lists-mode.md)** to see (Implementation View) or hide (List View) nested elements such as Indicators and Progress Reports

Further you can:

* **group list items** (except Indicators),
* **sort list items**,
* **change pagination** (number of items on page),
