### List view options

> _Available for: [Visitors](/visitors/visitor.md) and registered users ([Guests](/guests/guest.md), [Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), [Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

> _Applies to: [Recommendations](/visitors/recommendations.md), [Actions](/visitors/actions.md), [Indicators](/visitors/indicators.md), [SDG targets](/visitors/sdg-targets.md), and [Users](/managers/users-admin.md) ([Managers](/managers/manager.md) and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md) only) and [Pages](/admins/pages.md) ([Administrators](/admins/admin.md) only)_

On any list view you can use several features to customise your view:

* **[filter list items](/visitors/lists-filter.md)** by keyword, attribute and/or associated categories and related elements
* **[change view mode](/visitors/lists-mode.md)** to see (Implementation View) or hide (List View) nested elements such as Indicators and Progress Reports (only available for [Actions](/visitors/actions.md), [Indicators](/visitors/indicators.md), and [SDG targets](/visitors/sdg-targets.md))

Further you can:

* **group list items** (except Indicators),
* **sort list items**,
* **change pagination** (number of items on page),

#### Grouping

List items can be grouped by any category group that is applicable. It additionally allows the user to subgroup items.

> Depending on the specific configuration, items can be grouped by default, e.g. by Recommendation Cluster and/or by Organisation as pictured below
