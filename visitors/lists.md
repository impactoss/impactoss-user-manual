> _Available for: [Visitors](/visitors/visitor.md) and registered users ([Guests](/guests/guest.md), [Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), [Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

The filter and search functions of the application are powerful tools that can be used for a number of purposes, including:

* Exploring actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets by affected persons, or human rights treaty or other category any keyword of your choosing;
* Finding the actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets you wish to update or edit, either individually or as a group (only possible as an Administrator or Manager)

> Filtering to Edit: Managers can use the filter function to select the entities they wish to edit individually or in bulk. They must be logged in to do so. For more details on how to editing entities [Batch edit](/managers/batch-edit.md).

##### Expanding the Implementation Plan - 'Implementation View'

The Implementation Plan can be viewed in either 'List View' or 'Implementation View'. 'List View' gives the user an overview of the indicators and reports associated with an action whilst "Implementation View' gives the user a more detailed view and with direct access to any associated indicators and reports/data.  The user can toggle between the views in two ways:

1. By clicking on 'Implementation View' towards the top right-hand corner of the screen (see image at top of this page). Once selected the user can revert by clicking on 'List View' in the same place.
2. By clicking to expand the boxes in list view as described above.

The difference between the two views is illustrated below.

**List View**:

**Implementation View**

##### Grouping Actions

The default grouping of all Actions contained within the database is by Thematic Cluster. The user can change this as they wish to suit their needs.

![](/assets/v-actions-grouping.png)

By clicking on the cross next to the grouping the user can remove that category and select their preferred category from a drop down list. A sub-group category can also be selected if required.

##### Filtering

For a user there may be an overwhelming number of actions, nor may they all be of interest. The tool therefore offers a range of filtering options to help users narrow down the number of actions according to personal preferences or areas of interest.


**Filtering by Keyword (Reference or Title)**

Each Action has a reference number and title describing the action. Users can enter words or numbers in the box indicated on the image immediately above to filter the list of actions. For example, if a user was only interested in actions relating to 'prisons' they could enter that word into the filter box and the number of actions would immediately be reduced to only those with 'prison' in the reference:

![](/assets/v-list-search.png)

> Please note, the default number of search results returned at any time is 20. If a user wishes to view more than this at any one time they can scroll to the bottom of the page and select up to 100 per page from a drop down menu

**Filtering by Category, connected category, connection or attribute**

The filter list is a powerful tool for users, allowing them to filter actions (and also indicators and recommendations, as discussed in chapters below) in a variety of ways to suit their needs. The filter list can be located on the left hand side of the screen, as per the image at the top of this section.

Clicking on any of the headings in the filter list will bring out the categories of that taxonomy:

![](/assets/v-list-filter.png)

The pop out menu shows the user all of the categories and the number beside each one shows how many actions each category has associated with it. In this example we have a number of organisations who have either one or two actions associated with them and 559 actions which have yet to be assigned to an organisation. (Please note that this is test data).

The user can simply select which organisation they are interested in and the filter will be applied. If the list of options is long and the user is unable to see the one they would like, there is a search box within the filter pop-out.

For instance, if we select Office of the Attorney General then we are shown the two actions owned by that organisation:

![](/assets/v-list-filtered.png)

The filter the user has applied appears in the filter box in the centre of the page (circled in red). The user can choose to remove the filter for the Office of the Attorney General by clicking on the cross on the tag or they can choose to add another filter to reduce their search results even further. This can be done either using the filter list on the left-hand side or by typing a word or number into the filter box, as described above.

#### Filtering by keyword (Reference or Title)

The search box appears at the top of each of the following pages: actions, indicators, recommendations and SDG targets.

![](/assets/Search box.png)

The user can enter any keyword or reference number to search that particular set of entities (in the example above the 567 actions in the database).

The search function can be used to find specific entities (e.g. by entering a UPR recommendation reference number) or by searching for a group of similar entities (e.g. by entering 'prison' to view all actions involving prisons).

The search function searches the titles and the references - it does not search descriptions or any associated categories, or connections. To search by associated categories or connection the filtering system should be used.

##### Filtering by Category, connected category, connection or attribute

The filter function allows users to filter the results of the page they are on using some or all of the following criteria:

* Thematic cluster
* Organisation
* Human Rights Body
* Reporting Cycle
* Human Rights Issue
* Affected Persons
* SDG
* Action
* Indicator
* Recommendation
* SDG Target
* Draft/public status (administrators only)

The filtering system works in the same manner across the different pages. The arrow points to the filtering list on the actions page, which is always in the same place on all of the pages. To start filtering the user simply needs to click on the category, connected category or connection they wish to filter by. For example, if we want to filter by affected pesons body and click on that title, the following box appears

![](/assets/Filter list 3.png)

For example, if we wanted to filter by human rights issue on the recommendations page, the user simply needs to click on the 'affected persons title and the following box will appear:

![](/assets/Filter recs.png)

The list of human rights issues appears in the right hand column, through which the user can scroll. The number next to each issue indicates the number of results will be returned if this filter is applied. To apply the filter the user simply needs to select the check box to the left of the required issue.

Multiple filters can be applied by repeating the steps described above.

Once a filter is applied the tag appears in the search box:

![](/assets/Filter search box.png)

In the example above we have filtered for recommendations that fall within the issue of 'international obligations' and affect 'girls'. Should the user also wish to enter a keyword into the search box to further refine the results they can do so. Alternatively, if they wish to remove one of the filters they simply need to click on the cross in the tag box (as per the picture above).
