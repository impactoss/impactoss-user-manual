### List view options

> _Available for: _[_Visitors_](/visitors/visitor.md)_ and registered users \(_[_Guests_](/guests/guest.md)_, _[_Contributors_](/contributors/contributor.md)_, _[_Managers_](/managers/manager.md)_, and _[_Administrators_](/admins/admin.md)_\)_

On any list view, including for [Actions](/visitors/actions.md), [Indicators](/visitors/indicators.md), [Recommendations ](/visitors/recommendations.md), and optionally also [SDG Targets ](/visitors/sdg-targets.md), you can use several features to customise your view:

* [**filter list items**](/visitors/lists-filter.md) by keyword, attribute and/or associated categories and related elements
* [**change view mode**](/visitors/lists-mode.md) to see \(Implementation View\) or hide \(List View\) nested elements such as Indicators and Progress Reports

Further you can:

* **group list items** \(except Indicators\),
* **sort list items**,
* **change pagination** \(number of items on page\),

#### Grouping

List items can be grouped by any category group that is applicable. It additionally allows the user to subgroup items.

> Depending on the specific configuration, items can be grouped by default, e.g. by Recommendation Cluster and/or by Organisation as pictured below
