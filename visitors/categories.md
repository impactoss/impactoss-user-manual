#### Exploring Categories

![](/assets/Categories.png)The recommendations and actions that make up the National Implementation Plan are categorised in a number of different ways to allow visitors to Sadata to explore the information based on their specific areas of interest, or to arrange the information in a way which meets their needs. Each category has it's own unique 'tag' which is attached to recommendations, actions and indicators for users to easily identify how it is identified.

In the example above, the user can easily see a number of categories that the recommendation falls within. Hovering the cursor over any of the tags will bring up the full title, in this case 'CRC' is shown to be 'Convention on the Rights of the Child'. Clicking on any of the tags will take the user to a page specifically for that category, and display all recommendations and actions associated with it.

#### The Categories in Detail

**Human Rights Bodies: **This category covers all human rights bodies or mechanisms that can make recommendations to a State on how to implement its human rights obligations. There are three different types which may fall under this category:

* Treaty body committees: For each international human rights convention \(e.g. Convention on the Rights of the Child\) there is an accompanying Treaty Body Committee. This Committee comprises independent experts who carry out regular reviews of a country's record relating to its area of expertise. The body makes recommendations and it is these recommendations which are entered into Satada and are addressed through the National Implementation Plan. Samoa is not yet party to all of the core human rights treaties so for the time being there will be no recommendations falling within some of the human rights bodies within this category. 
* Universal Periodic Review: Every 4.5 years every member of the United Nations undergoes a Universal Periodic Review - a peer to peer review of each country's human rights record. The outcome document contains recommendations which are entered into Sadata in the same way as recommendations received from the treaty body committees. There is often overlap between some of these recommendations. This can lead to duplication of reporting but Sadata works to eliminate this and allow for a greater focus on implementation. 
* Special Procedures: The United Nations has many special procedures mandate holders - either working groups or individuals who are independent experts and who are granted a mandate to examine a particular human rights issue. Samoa received its first Special Procedures visit in August 2017 with a visit from the Working Group on Discrimination Against Women in Law and in Practice. Arising from these type of visits is a report also containing recommendations. When visits of this nature occur, new categories will be added and the recommendations also entered into Sadata, as with those from the treaty bodies and the UPR. 

Human Rights Bodies sub-categories:

| Human Rights Committee | Committee on Economic, Social and  Cultural Rights | Committee Against Torture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Committee on Migrant Workers | Committee on the Elimination of         Discrimination Against Women | Committee on the Rights of Persons     with Disabilities |
| **Committee on Enforced                        Disappearance** | **Committee on the Rights of the Child** | **Committee on the Elimination of         Racial Discrimination** |
| Sub-committee on the Prevention of     Torture | Universal Periodic Review |  |



**Cycles: **Both the treaty body reviews and the Universal Periodic Review are regular and ongoing. The 'Cycles' category allows recommendations to be classified by specific cycle. E.g. if the user wants to only view recommendations and associated actions from the most  recent Universal Periodic Review they can easily select this using the 'Cycles' category. 

The National Implementation Plan was initially developed using the recommendations received from the two most recent reviews for Samoa. Therefore there are only initially two Cycles sub-categories \(but this will grow over time\):

| CRC cycle 2-4 | UPR 2nd cycle |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
