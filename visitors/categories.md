#### Exploring Categories

![](/assets/Categories.png)The recommendations and actions that make up the National Implementation Plan are categorised in a number of different ways to allow visitors to Sadata to explore the information based on their specific areas of interest, or to arrange the information in a way which meets their needs. Each category has it's own unique 'tag' which is attached to recommendations, actions and indicators for users to easily identify how it is identified.

In the example above, the user can easily see a number of categories that the recommendation falls within. Hovering the cursor over any of the tags will bring up the full title, in this case 'CRC' is shown to be 'Convention on the Rights of the Child'. Clicking on any of the tags will take the user to a page specifically for that category, and display all recommendations and actions associated with it.

#### The Categories in Detail

![](/assets/1_humanRightsBody.png)

**Human Rights Bodies: **This category covers all human rights bodies or mechanisms that can make recommendations to a State on how to implement its human rights obligations. There are three different types which may fall under this category:

* Treaty body committees: For each international human rights convention \(e.g. Convention on the Rights of the Child\) there is an accompanying Treaty Body Committee. This Committee comprises independent experts who carry out regular reviews of a country's record relating to its area of expertise. The body makes recommendations and it is these recommendations which are entered into Satada and are addressed through the National Implementation Plan. Samoa is not yet party to all of the core human rights treaties so for the time being there will be no recommendations falling within some of the human rights bodies within this category. 
* Universal Periodic Review: Every 4.5 years every member of the United Nations undergoes a Universal Periodic Review - a peer to peer review of each country's human rights record. The outcome document contains recommendations which are entered into Sadata in the same way as recommendations received from the treaty body committees. There is often overlap between some of these recommendations. This can lead to duplication of reporting but Sadata works to eliminate this and allow for a greater focus on implementation. 
* Special Procedures: The United Nations has many special procedures mandate holders - either working groups or individuals who are independent experts and who are granted a mandate to examine a particular human rights issue. Samoa received its first Special Procedures visit in August 2017 with a visit from the Working Group on Discrimination Against Women in Law and in Practice. Arising from these type of visits is a report also containing recommendations. When visits of this nature occur, new categories will be added and the recommendations also entered into Sadata, as with those from the treaty bodies and the UPR. 

Human Rights Bodies sub-categories:

| Human Rights Committee | Committee on Economic, Social and  Cultural Rights | Committee Against Torture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Committee on Migrant Workers | Committee on the Elimination of         Discrimination Against Women | Committee on the Rights of Persons     with Disabilities |
| **Committee on Enforced                        Disappearance** | **Committee on the Rights of the Child** | **Committee on the Elimination of         Racial Discrimination** |
| Sub-committee on the Prevention of     Torture | Universal Periodic Review |  |

**Cycles: **Both the treaty body reviews and the Universal Periodic Review are regular and ongoing. The 'Cycles' category allows recommendations to be classified by specific cycle. E.g. if the user wants to only view recommendations and associated actions from the most  recent Universal Periodic Review they can easily select this using the 'Cycles' category.

The National Implementation Plan was initially developed using the recommendations received from the two most recent reviews for Samoa. Therefore there are only initially two Cycles sub-categories \(but this will grow over time\):

| CRC cycle 2-4 | UPR 2nd cycle |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

**Human Rights Issues: **The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has developed a [Human Rights Index](http://uhri.ohchr.org/en/) which contains a classification system that is the basis for the 'Human Rights Issues' category in Sadata. It helps users search by particular area of interest and see what the Government is doing in that field of work.

Human Rights Issues sub-categories:

| Scope of International Obligations | Cooperation with human rights           mechanisms and institutions | Inter-State cooperation and                 development assistance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Legal, institutional and policy                framework | Human rights education, training and  awareness raising | Context, statistics, budget, civil            society |
| **International criminal and                    humanitarian law** | **Right to self-determination** | **Equality and non-discrimination** |
| Right to development | Right to a remedy | Business and human rights |

| Civil & political rights - general            measures of implementation | Right to physical and moral integrity | Liberty and security of the person |
| **Fundamental freedoms** | **Administration of justice** | **Rights related to name, identity,          nationality** |
| Right to participation in public affairs and right to vote | Rights related to marriage and family | Economic, social and cultural rights -  general measures of implementation |

| Members of minorities | Indigenous peoples | Migrants |
| **Refugees & asylum seekers** | **Internally displaced persons** | **Human rights defenders** |

**Affected persons: **In the same way that 'Human Rights Issues' allows users to examine particular issues in detail, 'Affected Persons' allows the user to do that with a wide range of demographics. This is again based on the United Nations Human Rights Index system.

Affected persons sub-categories:

| Children | Children in street situations | Disappeared persons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Educational staff | General | Girls |
| **Human rights defenders** | **Indigenous peoples** | **Internally displaced persons** |
| Judges, lawyers and prosecutors | Law enforcement/police officials | Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and intersex persons \(LGBTI\) |
| **Media** | **Medical staff** | **Mercenaries** |
| Migrants | Military staff | Minorities/racial, ethnic, linguistic,       religious or descent-based groups |
| **Non-citizens** | **Older persons** | **Persons affected by armed conflict** |
| Persons deprived of their liberty | Persons living in poverty | Persons living in rural areas |
| **Persons living with HIV/AIDS** | **Persons with disabilities** | **Prison officials** |
| Private security | Public officials | Refugees & asylum seekers |
| **Rural women** | **Social workers** | **Stateless persons** |
| Vulnerable persons/groups | Women | Youth |

**Thematic clusters: **Samoa receives hundreds of recommendations from the human rights bodies, the Universal Periodic Review and the Special Procedures. There is often overlap between some of the recommendations and in many case they can essentially be the same. This can make the management of those recommendations more difficult than it needs to be. Sadata allows the Government to cluster recommendations into general headings to help alleviate this issue.

Clustering recommendations in this way not only helps make implementation more manageable but it also helps to identify crossover and eliminate duplication of work and reporting. The NMRF and Sadata work hand in hand to achieve this and the thematic clusters are an important part of that. The National Implementation Plan is a series of thematic clusters \(which each contain one of more recommendations\) for each of which the Government has identified a number of actions and indicators. As more recommendations are received by Samoa these can either be added to existing thematic clusters or a new cluster created.

For the user, this category once again allows them to explore potential areas of interest using the categorisation system. The thematic clusters are liable to change. At the launch date of Sadata, the initial draft thematic clusters are:

| Address child labour | Adoption | SDG Alignment of national planning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bring all places of detention into line  with the Mandela Rules | CRPD implementation | Climate change, disaster management and human rights |
| **Establishment of a National                Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-Up** | **Family and domestic violence** | **Gender equality and empowerment of women** |
| Harmonise laws with CRC | Human rights training for law               enforcement officials | Identify and address human trafficking |
| **Improved education** | **Improved health and healthcare** | **Improved water and sanitation** |
| Increased participation of women in   public life and decision making | law and justice sector legislative          review and reform | Mental health |
| **National Human Rights institution      establishment and strengthening** | **Protect and promote the rights of       children and youth** | **Protection of indigenous peoples and protection of land rights** |
| Raise human rights awareness and      increase human rights education | Ratify and implement outstanding        human rights treaties | Ratify the 3 optional protocols to the  CRC |
| **Sexual and reproductive health rights** | **Sexual orientation and gender identity** | **Submission of overdue reports to the Treaty Bodies** |

**Sustainable Development Goals: **In addition to being a tool which helps track and coordinate implementation of Samoa's human rights obligations, Sadata is also does the same in relation to the SDGs. Visitors can therefore click on this category to explore the SDG targets in more detail or to look into what actions the Government is taking to achieve the SDGs. Sadata helps to draw the links between the work the Government is doing in relation to the SDGs and the work it is doing in relation to human rights, again eliminating duplication and increasing efficiency.

| No poverty | Zero hunger | Good health and well-being |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Quality education | Gender equality | Clean water and sanitation |
| **Affordable and clean energy** | **Decent work and economic growth** | **Industry, innovation and infrastructure** |
| Reduced inequalities | Sustainable cities and communities | Responsible consumption and             production |
