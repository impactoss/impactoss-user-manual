#### Exploring Categories

![](/assets/Categories.png)The recommendations and actions that make up the National Implementation Plan are categorised in a number of different ways to allow visitors to Sadata to explore the information based on their specific areas of interest, or to arrange the information in a way which meets their needs. Each category has it's own unique 'tag' which is attached to recommendations, actions and indicators for users to easily identify how it is identified.

In the example above, the user can easily see a number of categories that the recommendation falls within. Hovering the cursor over any of the tags will bring up the full title, in this case 'CRC' is shown to be 'Convention on the Rights of the Child'. Clicking on any of the tags will take the user to a page specifically for that category, and display all recommendations and actions associated with it.
