#### View categories by category group (also called taxonomy)

By selecting any of the **category groups** on the left menu bar of the "Overview page" (see [Visitor overview](/visitors/visitor.md)) or any of the "Category group" pages you will be able to explore the different category groups listed and all associated recommendations, actions and optionally also SDG targets for each.

> Please note that IMPACT OSS can be configured with many different category groups and thus differ significantly from the list shown above

The recommendations and actions that make up the National Implementation Plan are categorised in a number of different ways (called taxonomies or category groups) to allow visitors to explore the information based on their specific areas of interest.

Pleasee find more information on some common taxonomies below "View single category".

#### View single category

You can explore any single category by selecting it from the category group overview page above. As pictured below you will see lists of all recommendations or actions that belong to this category:

For each list item you can also see all other categories and relationships (e.g. the actions a recommendations is addressed by) the category has been associated with - to help quickly identify the category group a category tag belongs to, the tags are coulored according to the groups's unique colour:

In the example above, the icons below the recommendation show the different tags that have been assigned. Hovering the cursor over any of the tags will bring up the full category title, in this case 'CRC' is shown to be 'Convention on the Rights of the Child'. Clicking on any of the tags will take the user to the specific category page.

#### Example Taxonomies

> Note: Taxonomies can include universal classifications of recommendations used by the UN such as and State-specific classifications of recommendations and actions (and users) such as

##### Human Rights Mechanisms (or Bodies)

![](/assets/icon-hr-bodies.png)

This taxonomy covers all different **Human Rights Mechanisms** that can make recommendations to a State on how to implement its human rights obligations. There are several different types of categories which may fall under this taxonomy:

* **Treaty Body Committees**: For each international human rights convention (e.g. Convention on the Rights of the Child) there is an accompanying Treaty Body Committee. The body makes recommendations to each State that has ratified the treaty and it is these recommendations which are entered into the application and are addressed through the National Implementation Plan.
* **Universal Periodic Review**: Every 4.5 years every member of the United Nations undergoes a Universal Periodic Review - a peer to peer review of each country's human rights record. The outcome document contains recommendations which are entered into the database in the same way as recommendations received from the treaty body committees.
* **Special Procedures**: The United Nations has many special procedures mandate holders - either working groups or individuals who are independent experts and who are granted a mandate to examine a particular human rights issue. Arising from these type of visits is a report also containing recommendations, which will be entered into the national Implementation Plan as above.
* Regional mechanisms: for some States there may also be relevant regional mechanisms providing recommendations.

##### Reporting cycles

![](/assets/icon-cycles.png)

Both the treaty body reviews and the Universal Periodic Review are regular and ongoing. The **Reporting Cycles** taxonomy allows recommendations to be classified by specific cycle. E.g. if the user wants to only view recommendations and associated actions from the most recent Universal Periodic Review they can easily select this using the 'Reporting Cycles' category.

##### Human rights issues (or 'Themes')

![](/assets/icon-hr-issues.png)

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has developed a [Human Rights Index](http://uhri.ohchr.org/en/) which contains a classification system that is the basis for the **Human Rights Issues** taxonomy. It helps users search by particular area of interest and see what the Government is doing in that field of work.

---

##### Affected persons (or 'Vulnerable groups')

![](/assets/icon-affected-persons.png)

In the same way that 'Human Rights Issues' allows users to examine particular issues in detail, **Affected Persons** allows the user to do that with a wide range of demographics. This is again based on the United Nations Human Rights Index system.

---

##### Recommendation Clusters (or 'National Themes')

![](/assets/icon-clusters.png)

Every United nations member State receives hundreds of recommendations from the human rights bodies, the Universal Periodic Review and the Special Procedures. There is often overlap between some of the recommendations and in many case they can be similar or be the same. This can make the management of those recommendations more difficult than it needs to be. The application allows the Government to cluster recommendations into general **Recommendation Clusters** to help alleviate this issue.

Clustering recommendations in this way can not only help to make implementation more manageable but it can also help to identify crossover and eliminate duplication of work and reporting.

---

##### Organisations (or 'Implementing Agencies')

![](/assets/icon-organisations.png)

The **Organisations** taxonomy lists the Government agencies (and others) carrying out actions contained within the National Implementation Plan. Visitors can use this taxonomy to easily see what work any particular Ministry is doing in the areas of human rights and the SDGs at the click of a button. If your organisation is doing a variety of work related to the actions contained with the National Implementation Plan you can contact the administrator using the 'Contact' link on the website to discuss your involvement.

##### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

![](/assets/icon-sdgs.png)

In addition to being a tool which helps track and coordinate implementation a country's human rights obligations, the application also does the same in relation to the **SDGs**. Visitors can therefore click on this taxonomy to explore the SDG Targets in more detail or to look into what actions the Government is taking to achieve the SDGs. The tool helps to draw the links between the work the Government is doing in relation to the SDGs and the work it is doing in relation to human rights, again eliminating duplication and increasing efficiency.

> Note: Depending on the configuration SDGs could also be used to classify Recommendations and/or Actions
