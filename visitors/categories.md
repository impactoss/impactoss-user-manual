The recommendations and actions that make up the National Implementation Plan are categorised in a number of different ways (called taxonomies or category groups) to allow visitors to explore the information based on their specific areas of interest.

Please find more information on some common taxonomies below "View single category".

For each list item you can also see all other categories and relationships (e.g. the actions a recommendations is addressed by) the category has been associated with - to help quickly identify the category group a category tag belongs to, the tags are coloured according to the group's unique colour:

In the example above, the icons below the recommendation show the different tags that have been assigned. Hovering the cursor over any of the tags will bring up the full category title, in this case 'CRC' is shown to be 'Convention on the Rights of the Child'. Clicking on any of the tags will take the user to the specific category page.
