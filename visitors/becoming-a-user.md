### 3.7 Becoming a User

Visitors to Sadata may want to become Users at some point, in order to upload a report/date for a particular indicator within the National Implementation Plan. E.g. an NGO who has conducted a human rights training program on the rights of person with disabilities would like it recorded in the National Plan.

##### Registration

Users have to be registered in the following way:

1. The person who wishes to be registered needs to click on the 'Register' link in the top right hand corner of any page within Sadata, as circled above. 
2. The person will then be asked to complete a registration form, entering their name, email address and a confirmed password \(see image below\)

3. Once completed that person will now be a registered Sadata User

\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering on Sadata as described above does not grant that user permission rights to upload information that will automatically appear, or to make access the back-end of the website. For that to happen an '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'  must either make that user responsible for the collection of data for one or more indicators \(thus becoming a '_[_Contributor_](#contributors)_'\) or they must change that users role to either '_[_Manager_](#managers)_' or '_[_Administrator_](#administrators)_'. \*\*_
