### Filter lists

Lists can be filtered by keyword or any associated category, related element or attribute. This can help you narrow down the number of list items according to personal preferences or areas of interest.

> Note: [Managers](/managers/manager.md) can use the filter function to select the entities they wish to edit individually or in bulk. They must be logged in to do so. For more details on how to edit multiple entities from the list view please see [Batch edit](/managers/batch-edit.md).

Any active filter will appear in the search field at the top of the list views:

#### Filtering by keyword (Reference or Title)

By typing into the search field you can filter list items by keyword, targeting each list item's title, and unique reference (sometime database id). The list will auto update and the number of matching items will accordingly reduce immediately.

> Please note: for a full text search that includes descriptions use the [Search feature](/visitors/search.md)

In the example pictured below, the list of actions was filtered by 'children':

> The keyword filter function can also be used to find specific entities, e.g. by entering a UPR recommendation reference number.

#### Filtering by Category, Connected Category, Connection or Attribute

Other filter options for specific associations can be found in the list side bar on the left hand side.

Filter options includes
* **Filter by Category**: allows filtering the list items by any Category they are tagged with, grouped by taxonomy
* **Filter by Connected Category** (where applicable): you can also filter items by a Category a connected element is tagged with, this allows for example filtering Actions by Human Rights Mechanisms that a Recommendation they address is tagged with
* **Filter by Connection** (where applicable): you can filter items by any other element they are related with, this allows for example filtering Actions by a specific Recommendation
* **Filter by Attribute** (where applicable): you can filter items by specific attributes and characteristics, for example if Recommendations have been accepted or not accepted and (if authorised) also by assigned user (also see [Explore Draft Content](/contributors/draft.md))

> Note: you can toggle (expand and collapse) filter option groups. Default toggle state may depend on the specific configuration

##### Example: how to filter a list of actions by Education category (of Thematic Cluster taxonomy)

![](/assets/v-list-filter.png)

Clicking on the 'Thematic Cluster' taxonomy in the filter list will bring out all Thematic Cluster  categories, including the number of list Actions each category 'tags'. From the cluster list you can simply select the cluster you are interested in and the filter will be applied. If the list of options is long you can also filter the list of filters using the search box above the filter options.

For instance, if we select 'Education' then we are presented with the 5 actions associated with that cluster of Recommendations:

The filter the user has applied now appears in the search field above the list (circled in red). You can remove the filter by clicking on the cross on the tag or you can choose additional filters (including keyword filters) to further reduce the number of list items.
