# History

The initial design for [IMPACT OSS](http://impactoss.org/) was produced by human rights consultant [Mr. Ashley Bowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-bowe-a4716019/) who was subsequently employed by the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/) to fundraise and project manage the development of the software.

The [United Nations Development Program in Samoa](http://www.ws.undp.org/) and [New Zealand Aid](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/aid-and-development/) generously provided the required resources, allowing a tender to be put out for development services. [Unfold Data](http://dumpark.com/) were the outstanding choice and have since played a substantial role in the history of [IMPACT OSS](http://impactoss.org/) and Sadata. Not only have they been responsible for all of the development they have also contributed significantly to the data visualisation and data architecture. Having previously worked on the [New Zealand National Plan of Action](http://npa.hrc.co.nz/) they brought an understanding of the need to address issues around data collection and duplication of reporting in relation to human rights reporting.

In addition to [Unpack Data](http://dumpark.com/), the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission](https://www.hrc.co.nz/) became the final partner in the development of [IMPACT OSS](http://impactoss.org/), initially providing in kind support and later funding the development of the Sustainable Development Goal module.

[IMPACT OSS](http://impactoss.org/) was born in Samoa and New Zealand and is now currently being used as the software platform for [Sadata ](https://sadata-staging.firebaseapp.com/actions)in Samoa and the [NPA ](http://npa.hrc.co.nz/#/)in New Zealand. From the outset it was decided that this revolutionary software would be opensource - a Pacific global offering to improve implementation and reporting of human rights and the SDGs around the world.
