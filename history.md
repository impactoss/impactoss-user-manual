# History

The initial design for IMPACT OSS was produced by human rights consultant [Mr. Ashley Bowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-bowe-a4716019/) who was subsequently employed by the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/) to fundraise and project manage the development of the software. The United Nations Development Program in Samoa and New Zealand Aid generously provided the required resources, allowing a tender to be put out for development services. Unpack Data were the outstanding choice and have since played a substantial role in the history of IMPACT OSS and Sadata. Not only have they been responsible for all of the development  they have also contributed significantly to the data visualisation and data architecture.
