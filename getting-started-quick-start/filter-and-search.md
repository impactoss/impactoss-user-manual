### 2.5 How to: Filter and Search

The filter and search functions of the application are powerful tools that can be used for a number of purposes, including:

* Exploring actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets by affected persons, or human rights treaty or other category any keyword of your choosing;
* Finding the actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets you wish to update or edit, either individually or as a group \(only possible as an Administrator user\)

#### Searching

The search box appears at the top of each of the following pages: actions, indicators, recommendations and SDG targets.

The user can enter any keyword or reference number to search that particular set of entities \(in the example above the 567 actions in the database\). 

The search function can be used to find specific entities \(e.g. by entering a UPR recommendation reference number\) or by searching for a group of similar entities \(e.g. by entering 'prison' to view all actions involving prisons\). 

The search function searches the titles and the references - it does not search descriptions or any associated categories, sub-categories or connection. To search by associated categories, sub-categories or connection the filtering system should be used.
