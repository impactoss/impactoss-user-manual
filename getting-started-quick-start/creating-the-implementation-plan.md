# 2. How To:

### 2.1 Create Your Implementation Plan

The Implementation Plan is essentially the State strategic plan on how it is going to implement its obligations. Like a strategic plan it has 'outcomes', 'activities' to achieve the outcomes, and 'indicators' to measure success of the activities.

The outcomes are the international obligations a State has under the human rights system and the Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, SDG Target 1.1 is to eradicate poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This is one of the outcomes which will make up a State implementation plan. Unlike the SDGs a State's human rights obligations can be specific, through recommendations received from the Treaty Body Committees, the Universal Periodic Review or the Special Procedures. These need to be entered into the database to form part of the implementation plan. Their obligations also extend to all of the substantive articles of the human rights conventions to which that State is a party. The software makes it easy to create an implementation plan for each of the human rights obligations and SDGs where actions that overlap only need to be reported on once and will get tracked against both plans. 

Once all of the outcomes are entered into the database there will be hundreds, often overlapping in nature and certainly difficult to manage. This is one of the issues the software is designed to address by helping States to cluster human rights recommendations and substantive articles into 'Thematic Clusters' using a sophisticated process to make them more manageable.

Once all State obligations have been clustered in this way, actions and indicators can be added to the clusters and recommendations. The indicators identify who is responsible for collecting that information and when it should be submitted. That person will receive an automated email with an upload link at that time \(and on a regular basis if required\). All data uploaded will be linked to each relevant State obligation - therefore if work done on training new police recruits helps to achieve SDG target 16.3, CRC recommendation 48 and  UPR recommendation 107.8 it will report against all, despite only having to be uploaded once.

#### Creating Your Human Rights Implementation Plan in 3 Easy Steps

**1.Enter human rights recommendations or Convention articles **

This can either be done by importing recommendations or articles in bulk or entering them one by one. Simply click on the 'Recommendations ' tab in the top menu bar and get going. For more information on adding recommendations and articles [click here](/visitors/recommendations.md).

**2. Cluster your recommendations and articles**

By creating clusters the wide ranging obligations become more manageable and easier to track. There are two ways to cluster recommendations and articles. The most efficient is to go to the 'Recommendations' tab in the top menu bar as above and \(1\) use the filtering and search functions to find similar obligations, \(2\) select them and then \(3\) click on 'Thematic Cluster' in the left hand menu bar to create and name a new cluster to put them in. ![](/assets/Clustering.png)Alternatively, recommendations or articles could be allocated to clusters individually by finding the one you want, clicking on it to edit and assigning it to a cluster. More information on both approaches can be found [here](/visitors/recommendations.md). 

**3. Add actions and indicators**

**Monitor and update**
