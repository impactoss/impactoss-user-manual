# 2. How To:

### 2.1 Create Your Implementation Plan

The Implementation Plan is essentially the State strategic plan on how it is going to implement its obligations. Like a strategic plan it has 'outcomes', 'activities' to achieve the outcomes, and 'indicators' to measure success of the activities.

The outcomes are the international obligations a State has under the human rights system and the Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, SDG Target 1.1 is to eradicate poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This is one of the outcomes which will make up a State implementation plan. Unlike the SDGs a State's human rights obligations can be specific, through recommendations received from the Treaty Body Committees, the Universal Periodic Review or the Special Procedures. These need to be entered into the database to form part of the implementation plan. Their obligations also extend to all of the substantive articles of the human rights conventions to which that State is a party. The software makes it easy to create an implementation plan for each of the human rights obligations and SDGs where actions that overlap only need to be reported on once and will get tracked against both plans.

Once all of the outcomes are entered into the database there will be hundreds, often overlapping in nature and certainly difficult to manage. This is one of the issues the software is designed to address by helping States to cluster human rights recommendations and substantive articles into 'Thematic Clusters' using a sophisticated process to make them more manageable.

Once all State obligations have been clustered in this way, actions and indicators can be added to the clusters and recommendations. The indicators identify who is responsible for collecting that information and when it should be submitted. That person will receive an automated email with an upload link at that time \(and on a regular basis if required\). All data uploaded will be linked to each relevant State obligation - therefore if work done on training new police recruits helps to achieve SDG target 16.3, CRC recommendation 48 and  UPR recommendation 107.8 it will report against all, despite only having to be uploaded once.

#### Creating Your Human Rights Implementation Plan in 3 Easy Steps

**1.Enter human rights recommendations or Convention articles **

This can either be done by importing recommendations or articles in bulk or entering them one by one. Simply click on the 'Recommendations ' tab in the top menu bar and get going. For more information on adding recommendations and articles [click here](/visitors/recommendations.md).

**2. Cluster your recommendations and articles**

By creating clusters the wide ranging obligations become more manageable and easier to track. There are two ways to cluster recommendations and articles. The most efficient is to go to the 'Recommendations' tab in the top menu bar as above and \(1\) use the filtering and search functions to find similar obligations, \(2\) select them and then \(3\) click on 'Thematic Cluster' in the left hand menu bar to create and name a new cluster to put them in.

**3. Add actions and indicators**

Now the framework for the human rights Implementation Plan has been created all that is left to do is add the actions \(and associated indicators\) that will achieve it. Adding actions and indicators can also be done individually or by importing multiple entries at once. First click on the 'Action' or 'Indicator' page in the top menu bar and then select whether to import or add.

If adding multiple entries then the actions/indicators can then be assigned to clusters or individual recommendations/articles using the filter and edit process. If adding one by one then at the time of creation this can be done. Additionally, if you are creating a single action you can also create the indicator\(s\) associated with it as part of the same process, without having to click on the 'indicators' tab in the top menu bar. For more information on how to carry out these functions [click here](/users/actions.md).

Whilst multiple indicators can be imported it is important to edit each one individually as this is where responsibility for an indicator can be allocated to a user. For instance if Rosemary Bowe is responsible for conducting human rights training for new police recruits every six months then she needs to be given responsibility for uploading the training data twice a year. This can be done when creating a new indicator or editing an old indicator. Rosemary must be an existing registered user or will need to be sent a registration link for this to happen.

Actions and indicators can and should also be linked to the SDG targets where appropriate. For instance if the work Rosemary is doing, as described above, also helps to meet SDG target 16.3 it can be linked when the action or indicator is being created. That means that any data Rosemary uploads will also be tracked against SDG 16.3 even though it is only uploaded once.

_\*\*\***Top Tip\***\*\* States should start off by looking at what is already planned in the coming years which will already address the thematic clusters and once this is done that will identify where the gaps are and actions can be devised to help meet these gaps. At any point it is easy to check whether gaps exit by going to the recommendations page and filtering to see which recommendations do not currently have any actions._

**Finally**: **Monitor and update**

The Implementation Plan is never finished! States will continue to receive additional recommendations from the Treaty Body Committees, the UPR and the Special Procedures. Once any new recommendations are received then these need to be entered into the database, assigned to existing or new clusters and actions assigned to them to make sure they are addressed.

**The SDG Implementation Plan**

The SDG Implementation Plan works in exactly the same way as above except for the need for clustering the targets as this has already occurred given they are grouped within specific SDGs. If a State is using the software for both human rights and SDG reporting then as soon as they have finished developing one then work has already started on the other, as actions will have been linked across the two plans. It then just requires the State to identify the gaps and add in extra actions and indicators.

The SDG Implementation Plan can be developed on its own using the steps above \(omitting the thematic clustering\), as can the Human Rights Implementation Plan. however, States receive additional benefits from using the two in conjunction with each other as it eliminates duplication of reporting and activities across human rights obligations and the SDGs.
