# 2. How To:

### 2.1 Create Your Implementation Plan

The Implementation Plan is essentially the State strategic plan on how it is going to implement its obligations. Like a strategic plan it has 'outcomes', 'activities' to achieve the outcomes, and 'indicators' to measure success of the activities. 

The outcomes are the international obligations a State has under the human rights system and the Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, SDG Target 1.1 is to eradicate poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This is one of the outcomes which will make up a State implementation plan. Unlike the SDGs a State's human rights obligations can be specific, through recommendations received from the Treaty Body Committees, the Universal Periodic Review or the Special Procedures. These need to be entered into the database to form part of the implementation plan. Their obligations also extend to all of the substantive articles of the human rights conventions to which that State is a party. 

Once all of the outcomes are entered into the database there will be hundreds, often overlapping and certainly difficult to manage. This is one of the issues the software is designed to address by helping States to cluster recommendations, substantive articles and SDG targets into 'Thematic Clusters' using a sophisticated process to make them more manageable.
