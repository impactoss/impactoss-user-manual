### 2.2 How to: Report \(add data\)

Adding progress reports is critical to the success of using this tool. Progress reports contain the data required for each indicator of the Implementation Plan. This regular entry of data allows States, civil society and other stakeholders to check progress of the Plan and ensures that required reporting is just a matter of analysing the data and writing the narrative - no more chasing around Ministries trying to obtain information from the past 5 years from people who are too busy to respond, when it may not even exist.

Data can be entered through progress reports by civil servants, administrators of the database or civil society and other stakeholders.

#### **Reporting as an Indicator Owner**

Each indicator in the Implementation Plan is assigned to a user who is responsible for uploading the relevant information, either as a once off or on a regular basis. That user will receive an automated email when the information is due.

ii. Enter login details \(if not already signed in\)

iii. Filter the indicators using the 'My Indicators' option and click on the relevant indicator

iv. Click on 'Add Report' \(1 or 2 below\)![](/assets/Add report.png)

1\) Title: The title of the progress report \(E.g. 'Domestic violence stats Q3 2017' or 'NHRI CEDAW Training Workshop for Police Recruits'

2\) Description: Full details of the progress report

3\) Upload document: Information/data related to the indicator should be uploaded via this link

4\) Public/Private: The status of the uploaded document can be set to public or private depending on whether there is sensitive information contained within that should not be available publicly

5\) Draft/public: The status of the progress report. Once it is ready to publish on the public site, this status should be immediately changed to public.

6\) Due date: As an administrator, both scheduled and unscheduled progress reports can be entered. The Administrator is required to indicate here whether the progress report they are uploading is unscheduled or scheduled.

7\) Save/cancel: This is where the Administrator can save all of the details that have been entered, or clear the form using the cancel button
