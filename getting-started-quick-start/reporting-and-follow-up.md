### 2.2 How to: Report \(add data\)

Adding progress reports is critical to the success of using this tool. Progress reports contain the data required for each indicator of the Implementation Plan. This regular entry of data allows States, civil society and other stakeholders to check progress of the Plan and ensures that required reporting is just a matter of analysing the data and writing the narrative - no more chasing around Ministries trying to obtain information from the past 5 years from people who are too busy to respond, when it may not even exist.

Data can be entered through progress reports by civil servants, administrators of the database or civil society and other stakeholders.

#### **Reporting as an Indicator Owner**

Each indicator in the Implementation Plan is assigned to a user who is responsible for uploading the relevant information, either as a once off or on a regular basis. That user will receive an automated email when the information is due.

Once an email reminder hass been received the Indicator Owner simply needs to: 

* Click on the link in the email \(not pictured\)
* Enter login details \(if not already signed in\)
* Filter the indicators using the 'My Indicators' option and click on the relevant indicator
* Click on 'Add Report' \(1 or 2 below\)![](/assets/Add report.png)
