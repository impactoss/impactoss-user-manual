### 2.4 How to: Edit and Create Entities

The database is made up of information entered into it by the State and is designed so that it is flexible and can be used in a way that meets the needs of any country. All of the information and categorisations are totally flexible and can be created and edited as needed. The following can be classified as entities within the database:

* Categories \(human rights body, reporting cycle, human rights issue, affected persons, thematic clusters, organisations, SDGs\)
* Actions
* Indicators
* Recommendations
* SDG Targets

_\*\*\***Key Fact**\*\*\* To edit or create entities you need to be assigned as an 'Administrator' after you register as a user. Once you are signed in as an Administrator it is very easy to create or add entities._

**Editing Entities**

To edit any entity an Administrator can simply click on the entity they wish to edit at any time, on any of the pages of the application. Clicking on the entity will bring up the full details and an 'edit' button.

_Example: Editing an affected person category_

First the Administrator needs to navigate to where their entity can be found. To edit any category \(as listed above\) the Administrator needs \(1 below\) to click on the 'Categories' link in the top menu bar and then \(2\) click on the relevant category. Clicking on any of the subcategories \(3\), such as 'Children', brings up the second image below, from where the Administrator can go in to edit the entity and all associations it has \(e.g. linked recommendations, actions, etc.\):![](/assets/Categories 2.png)![](/assets/Edit children.png)

The same approach is required to any action, indicator, recommendation or SDG target - simply find the entity in question, click on it and hit the 'edit' button to get going.

For more detailed instructions on how to edit please see the relevant sections for [categories](/visitors/categories.md), [actions](/users/actions.md), [indicators](/users/indicators.md), [recommendations ](/visitors/recommendations.md)and [SDG targets](/visitors/sdg-targets.md).

**Batch editing**

Batch editing can be carried out in relation to actions, indicators, recommendations and SDG targets, but not categories. It allows an Administrator to update multiple entities at once in any of the following ways:

* Add multiple actions or indicators to a thematic cluster
* Assign multiple actions or indicators to an organisation
* Assign multiple indicators to an SDG
* Tag multiple actions or recommendations with any connected category \(human rights body, cycle, human rights issue, affected persons, SDGs\)
* Link multiple actions or indicators to any connection \(action,indicator, recommendation or SDG target\)
* Link multiple recommendations to actions
* Change the draft/public status of multiple actions, indicators, recommendations or SDG targets
* Change or denote the Government response to multiple UPR recommendations

The batch edit function works in the same manner for all of the above use cases and is demonstrated below.

First the Administrator needs to identify and select the actions they wish to batch edit and then secondly they update the selected actions as they wish.

1\) The Administrator can select the actions they wish by first using the filtering and search functions to bring up the relevant actions on their screen. More information on how to use these functions can be found [here](/visitors/actions.md). Once the relevant actions have been identified the Administrator can either:

* Select individual actions using the checkbox next to each action \(see \#1 on image below\)
* Select all actions on the page displayed \(see \#2 on image below\)
* Select all actions returned by the search and filtering results if they do not fit onto a single display page \(see \#3 on image below![](/assets/Selecting actions.png)

2\) Once the relevant actions have been selected the Administrator can then use the menu on left hand side of the screen to link the selected actions to any category, connected category or connection. For example, if the selected actions were to be linked to a particular thematic cluster the Administrator would click on the thematic cluster title in the left hand menu bar and the box 1 below will appear. Box 2 shows what happens when the Administrator selects the thematic cluster they wish to link to the actions:

![](/assets/Batch edit actions.png)1\) The Administrator can use the filter box to search for the thematic cluster \(or category/sub-category/connection\) they wish to find

2\) Where some, but not all of the selected actions are already linked to a thematic cluster the Administrator is shown a box with a horizontal line. By clicking once on any of these boxes \(so that a tick appears\) and then 'Update' the Administrator could update the thematic cluster to either be linked with **all **of the selected actions. By clicking on the box twice \(so that the box is empty\) and then 'Update' the Administrator can **unlink** all of the selected actions from that thematic cluster.

3\) Where a thematic cluster is not currently linked to any of the selected actions the Administrator is shown a blank box. By clicking once in any of these boxes \(so that a tick appears\) and then 'Update' the Administrator could update the thematic cluster to either be linked with **all **of the selected actions. In this example, the box on the right demonstrates how this works if the Administrator selects 'CRPD Implementation'

4\) If a thematic cluster does not exist which the Administrator wishes to link all of the selected actions to they can create one using this button

5\) At the top of the list is a summary of how many thematic clusters are already linked to all or some of the actions. By clicking once on this box \(so that a tick appears\) and then 'Update' the Administrator can link **all** of the selected actions to **all **of the thematic clusters**.** By clicking on the box twice \(so that it is blank\) and then 'Update' the Administrator can unlink all of the selected actions from all of the thematic clusters.

6\) When a thematic cluster is selected then a tick will appear in the box

7\) The 'Update' button will only be active once the Administrator has made one of the changes described above. Clicking on the update button will save those changes. This may take several seconds if editing a large number of actions at once.
