#### Who are Contributors?

Contributors are users that are usually the data owners of information relevant for one or more Indicators and are thus a key to the success of the data entry. Once assigned to an Indicator they are responsible for uploading relevant information at the required time.

##### Email reminders

If a reporting schedule has been set up for an assigned indicator, Contributors receive automated reminder emails shortly before and after the progress report is due.

> Note: while the reporting schedule frequency can be set for each indicator, the reminder email frequency and lead period (the period before the due date) can depend on the configuration. In the default configuration the lead period is **30 days** and the email frequency is **weekly** before the due date and **daily** after the due date
