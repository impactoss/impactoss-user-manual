### Explore Draft Content

> _Available for: [Contributors](/contributors/contributor.md), and all other authorised users ([Managers](/managers/manager.md), and [Administrators](/admins/admin.md))_

Once promoted to Contributor (or higher role), you will be able to see all draft content that has not yet been made public. This sections shows how to view all draft items in a list and how to recognise draft content. For publishing draft items, please see [Publish items](/managers/publish.md)

#### Viewing lists of draft content

You can also filter any item list ([Recommendations](/visitors/recommendations.md), [Actions](/visitors/actions.md), [SDG Targets](/visitors/sdg-targets.md), and [Indicators](/visitors/indicators.md)) by publication status:

1. Locate and open the 'Publication status' filter (in some configurations simply called 'Status') located in the 'Attributes' filter option group. Notice how for each 'Publication status' the number of available items is displayed on the right.

2. Select 'Publication status' option 'Draft' to only show items that are in 'draft'. Notice that the filter option 'Draft' has been added to the search bar.

> Please note: filter options are only available when any of the currently displayed list items match. For example if you already filtered the list for 'Public' items, the filter option 'Draft' is no longer offered as list items cannot be 'public' and 'draft' at the same time - to see the draft items you will first have to remove the 'Public' filter and then add the 'Draft' filter.


Please also see the section **[Lists: filter, group & more](/visitors/lists.md)** for more list operations.

#### Recognising draft content

Depending on the context, items that are in 'draft' are either directly labelled accordingly, or when connected displayed differently using inverse colours. In particular the different ways 'draft' content is shown are:

##### Draft status in single view

In the single item view, the publication status is shown in the top right corner (as highlighted in the screenshot below).

##### Draft status in list view

When displayed in a list, 'draft' items are labelled 'DRAFT' in the top right corner (as highlighted in the screenshot below).

##### Draft status of categories and associated items

When category items are in 'draft' status but already associated with a list item (such as actions), then the category tags are displayed with inverse colours (white background with coloured text and outline as displayed in the screenshot below).

Similarly, a small circle with inverse colours is displayed for any other connected 'draft' items (such as recommendations, see below)
